3,I order 3 of them and one of the item is bad quality. Is missing back spring so I have to put a pus of aluminium to make the battery work.,0
5,Well they are not Duracell but for the price i am happy.,1
3,"These do not hold the amount of high power juice like energies or duracell, but they are half the price.",0
5,I find amazon basis batteries to be equal if not superior to name brand ones. An't believe I didn't start buying them sooner! The packages are large and the price is great too.,1
3,"When I first started getting the Amazon basic batteries I really liked them. With recent purchases, they do not seem to last like they had, or maybe a mixed-bag (inconsistent with some lasting better than others). I have not done any tests, but feel some other bands may last longer. However, the price is hard to beat.",0
5,"Use it for my fish tank's light at night and works great, I love how you can easily switch it off and on if you want it on while guests are there.",1
1,I don't know if I would buy thus brand again seems like they don't last as long as Duracell,0
2,"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail camera. Camera were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. of buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basis is great for things like sheets and bleeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of ana and a size we purchased were lacking.",0
3,Ought these batteries for my Christmas gifts the month of (december) only lasted like months toys now need replacement batteries . I also used some for my doorbell and just now needs replacement batteries. Iv Remote control is still working but these batteries don't last very long...,0
5,His was my second purchase of amazon batteries and they work great. Must as good or even better than name brand batteries and half the price. His will be the only way I purchase batteries from now on!,1
5,They last as long as Duracell batteries in my Box one controller and none of them exploded like some of the reviews said.,1
1,These do not last long at all very cheap batteries no happy,0
5,He've ordered these a few times cause we've been so happy with product. These are good quality. He are also happy with price. I would recommend these.,1
5,HAVE NOT HAD CHANCE of USE ALL of THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALL of THEM WILL REMAIN of GOOD ORDER FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT of TIME MEANING A FEW YEARS OUT.,1
3,"these were under a light we thought they were there to fit the light when they arrived and nice company they were not the batteries we needed it should have been a but that is ok,it was our fault not knowing this. thanks..",0
5,Very convenient to have a box of batteries and at a good price. To longer need to compare pricking in stores. Should have done this long time ago.,1
3,Must got them so i really wont no for a few weeks or so how good these batteries are,0
5,These last as well as Energizer- half the price.,1
1,"These batteries are horrible. He depend on of batteries for many tireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. He switched to Amazon basis to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity.",0
5,"rd purchase of these of from Amazon, all have expiration of 2027. Ones I've used thus far last as Long as name bands",1
3,"I put these batteries in 10 of the 12 window candles that I bought - I put my last 2 Duracell in the other 2. The Amazon Batteries lasted for about 10 days and the Duracell lasted for 12. Since then I've experimented to see if this is consistent . It is, the Duracell last an average of 17 longer.",0
1,"First time I bought these they worked well and lasted almost as long as the name bands. Not the same this time around, almost no charge - 4-6 hours of run time - Sunk batteries.",0
5,Seem to work very well at a great price.,1
1,These batteries don't last even in a simple digital clock. 2 weeks at best.,0
5,"I buy AAA and of batteries about 4 - 6 times a year. I made the switch to Amazon batteries about 2 years ago and never looked back. These batteries work just as well as any of the name bands, but at a much more reasonable cost.",1
1,"Late on the back of these were 1992. Yeah, 1992. Inedible.",0
5,The 48 packs are the lowest price per of battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new of batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not footing with charging every night is worth it to me.,1
5,I definitely love the price and quantity.. By kiss go through them to fast. It least these will last a while..,1
1,Battery storage life only lasted 8 months (stored indoors).,0
2,"Of it's possible to have gotten a did batch I sure got it. He BLEW through all these batteries in less than a month. By kiss toys aren't that super lowered and even in remote I was having to change batteries way too often. For example the magic touch counting toy, the store batteries lasted 3 years. Topped in some Amazon batteries, 1 month and the second child didn't play with it nearly as much as the first. For the price it was worth the try but I'm going back to the other bands.",0
5,NICE PRODUCT,1
5,Great basic batteries! Fantastic price. I like having a stockpile. When my kiss get toys at Christmas I feel like Pray. YOU get a battery! and YOU get a battery!...,1
3,Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remote and of transmitted as even other store brand alkaline batteries.,0
5,Not it and it's already in use.,1
2,"I can only use these on those indoor blameless candles and even then, they dont last very long...a little disappointed...",0
5,"Lieutenant An got me these batteries. To then I got a call from him, saying we dont have to worry about batteries no more. And I said, that good! One less thing. -Forest",1
1,During my first charging they were leaking and wrapping was coming off. A waste of money,0
2,TERRIBLE! Rarely lasted three hours during a digital camera shoot where Duracell lasts multiple days.,0
5,I bought these batteries to use with a battery operated pump that transfers gas from a gas can into the tank of my riding power. His is a far better way of feeling my power than trying to lift a five gallon tank and trying to empty it into the power tank. The pump uses 4 of batteries and that is the way the Amazon batteries are package. Having them bundles in foursomes is convenient. By pump runs perfectly with these batteries.These batteries are said to have a shelf life of ten years so I won't be having to buy more of batteries for at least that long. The price of these batteries is a genuine bargain and is it highly recommended to get this offer if of batteries are needed.,1
5,Seem to work one for a fraction of the price!,1
1,These don't last long at all.,0
5,AAA batteries. They last adequately and are at a very competitive price point. For that reason I don't think I will be buying batteries from any competitor if they're more expensive than these. Bravo Amazon.,1
2,"Use these in a tireless of mouse. Was about 30 less life as copper top brand. Good price, but most likely will not buy again.",0
5,Great product and u can't beat this price anywhere,1
1,"Lasted about a week in my electric toothbrush. Energizer and Duracell brand lasted a month. Cried with 4 different Amazon batteries, same results. Very dissatisfied",0
5,You get what you pay for in life but for the price and amount these are actually great one say or two days of strong power for flashlights or tireless headphones etc. For remote theyblast for quite a while. Package was nice fast delivery thinking of actually buying different sizes for other electronics ...would definitely order again ...kind like gas not premium or regular something like a plus ....ll i have tried all those other expensive bands that supposed to last six more longer well by the time you pay for one pack and get maybe a months with depending on usage you could have a 100 of these and still have left over......just saying your not buying tires or rakes for your car so test them out they sell it in smaller amounts and subscription amount etc....,1
3,"They didn't last very long in my cheap camera. With them not being lithium I didn't expect them to last forever, but I should of gotten more then a days use out of them. In my Box controller they lasted an adequate amount of time. To all in all these definitely aren't for heavy use and the price point reflect that.",0
3,Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four night lights. Half of these were the AmazonBasics of batteries. Not surprising until I tell you that that AmazonBasics batteries were the last to be installed and the other half were installed long before the AmazonBasics. I don't think I'll buy these again.,0
5,Vice price for a bunch of batteries.,1
5,"AAA batteries - lots of them, at an unfordable price. That's not to like",1
3,Mediocre performance,0
5,like it for the money,1
2,"He use battery operated candles with times. The batteries normally have to be changed once a month. These cheap batteries lasted 2 weeks. I thought these batteries were a good deal, but I was wrong.",0
1,All the batteries came dead so I did a return and got new ones. Second order was the same as the first.Update: still have yet to receive refund from second order after several weeks!!!,0
5,Work well at a lower price. All is good.,1
1,all dead,0
2,"Maybe mine is a bad batch, had a serious leak on one of them, these batteries seem to last as long as duracells but duracells never leaned in my experience",0
5,Always a good buy!,1
5,"Must as good as name bands, lasts longer and no mercury.",1
5,With all the electronics in the house we go through abundance of batteries a month. His is a great deal and they seem to last quite a long time!Have mine set up to be shipped every month definitely the best way to go!,1
3,Batteries don't last very long compared to Duracell or Energizer,0
5,On't waste your coin of the expensive store bands. These work great.,1
1,"By 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn't getting any juice. Cried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn't work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contracted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn't return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without of for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energies batteries. Wouldn't you know it, the remote fired right back up. An't trust these batteries.",0
1,"I use hundreds of AAAs annually, and despite the graphics in ad, these are about the poorest performing, with least longevity, of any I have bought. Still have another 100 of these, but will likely go thou those quickly.",0
5,I'll never buy another brand again. Amazon batteries last! Quality and unfordable!,1
5,That else can you say Amazon ROCKS and so do their batteries!!!,1
2,Does not last as long as Duracell quantum. These were sent as a supplement,0
1,"These are budget friendly but don't last! I bought for my battery operated candles that typically use batteries for 6-8 weeks. Twice these batteries barely lasted 1 week. It was so disappointing. Amazon produce are usually so good, but I would not recommend these.",0
5,Great value,1
5,"Batteries were expensive, work well in multiple devices.I hate running out of triple A batteries!",1
3,The juice in these batteries aren't long term.,0
5,Right of alkaline batteries... not too much to say: New. Shrink-wrapped. Delivered quickly safely. Work just like we need of batteries to work.To problems here.RecommendedGo for it,1
1,"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Now expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again.",0
5,"Run of the mill batteries, for the price and convenience, especially with Crime shipping, are a good buy.",1
3,Is expected.,0
3,"Is expected from Amazon, there were no problems with the ordering and delivery process. To far I have installed several batteries, but it's too soon to tell how long they are going to last.",0
5,GREAT VALUE,1
5,I work in an electronics lab and did a test against the big name batteries and the discharge curve and performance was exactly the same as the brand that stars with E !!! Very good value,1
2,"It least half of this batch had no charge, or at least so little that they died within an hour of being put in a wilkie-take. Very disappointed",0
5,Batteries work better than the ones I charge. To I'll probably buy batteries in bulk instead of charging from now on. I'll still need to buy rechargeables for my solar devices.,1
2,These were of. I don't think I'll but them in the future. I prefer Energizers.,0
5,Last about 8 hours of non stop use which is about average. But the price was AMAZING!,1
3,"Recent battery, but seem to change them out a little bit faster than the big name batteries.",0
2,These batteries won't last long. In led flashlight will drain them in a hurry. I usually like Amazon products but this is one to avoid.,0
5,A lot of batteries for a good price! Same on time!,1
5,These batteries are a no trainer. They work great and the price can't be beat.,1
1,Not good,0
1,"I've been using these on my rou remote and the lifespan is terrible. About two weeks, when Duracell's have been 1-2 months",0
1,Awful poor performance. By mouse ran for several weeks to several months from Duracells but have never gotten more that several days from these. Will not buy again.,0
1,These batteries do not hold charge well. By the time I need to use it few weeks none of them work,0
1,"BAD BATCH NOT LASTING!Have been using these for the You Remote, and they are dying after just a few days of use.Have been happy with Amazon battery purchases in the past.Not sure if the quality is overall lower than it once was, or if this was just a bad batch.",0
2,They for really fast,0
2,Some of the four packs (02-2027) are bad upon first use.,0
1,These did not work. Wanted to make sure I had batteries for the item I was purchasing but they did not work. I had to dig some out of my june drawer.,0
1,Wrong item.,0
2,"They last a day in an box controller, if you're lucky",0
1,Any of the batteries are no good.,0
1,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries To. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. May the extra for name brand.,0
1,"Terrible. Must changed the batteries on my tireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. But another set in low lowered christmas lights. Head in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, lowered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. On't make this mistake again.",0
5,"Fantastic bargain and holding up well months later. I go through a lot of batteries, like almost everyone nowadays. To I searched for a better deal. I think I found it here. A big savings over grocer store batteries.",1
5,"Great deal. I go through these like water through a siege. USB mouse, flashlights, etc.",1
5,Works great and seems to last as long as my other batteries.,1
5,A lot of batteries for a little money. That more could you want,1
5,"good bargain. haven't had them long enough to determine life, but so far so good!",1
5,Great bargain.,1
5,I more than recommend this purchase. I encourage it. The batteries work great. A bargain at the price and how many you get. I won't be buying batteries anywhere else again.,1
5,Good batteries at a good price. They do the job. I've moved almost everything to was and need to keep disposables for hurricane season (no power for weeks) These are just right.,1
5,Basic of batteries for a good price.,1
5,"Easy decision, the amazon basis line of products has always worked well for me, and amazon customer service on their stuff is amazing if you need it.There is little difference in Alkaline batteries. (Osteo hits top rank in consumer reports, but I have not seen their amazon battery rating.)But ordering from amazon is so easy, and the quality is good",1
5,Great batteries at a great value.,1
5,"The box is actually quite nice for storage. It is flat, and easy to open.",1
3,"That we expected, a bargain battery, so we are happy.",0
5,"Using my el cheap multimeter (Luke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerable for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. To buds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapped in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name bands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charge, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available.",1
5,A nice bunch of batteries that work exactly as supposed to. Basis indeed!!,1
3,Great price.,0
5,great value. I will purchase again.,1
3,"Batteries are great, price isn't the best. I've seen similar packs of genetic batteries for cheaper. Germans comes to mind..",0
3,Batteries are great.....I need them for my work for my camera for taking pictures on the job of properties. Vice to have extra on hand at an unfordable price. I don't see that they last any less time than the name brand batteries.,0
5,"I used these batteries in a Canon 420 Speedflash. Normally, under multiple exposure (around 3 shots per second), using standard alkaline I'd get 3 continuous flashes before a miss, or with fancy High Discharge Late Clash batteries (translate - Expensive!), I'd get 5-6 continuous flashes. The last photography shoot, I was asked to get back-to-back images of a person at a surprise Birthday Party. Imagine my surprise when, upon entry of the victim, I captured 9 continuous exposures with perfect flash! I am very impressed!These batteries are high quality and surprisingly powerful!",1
5,Batteries work as promised. To far they seem to last and have not had any issues. Our kiss blow though lots of batteries and for the price these are a must have.,1
3,good part is that they give you a lot of them. bad part is they die way too quickly.,0
1,These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.,0
2,"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my of. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap A-o-sac or a grocer store brand.",0
1,His batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.,0
1,"I have two Sacs, each with their own tireless mac keyboard. I used these batteries in both keyboard and each worked great for several days. By desk keyboard failed to connect last week so I attempted to replace the batteries, but they had expanded inside the keyboard and will not come out. I assumed it was a chance happening. But now my tireless keyboard at my downstairs computer just failed. The batteries have expanded inside that keyboard as well and will not come out. Amazon refused us for the batteries but now we need to replace the two keyboard the batteries ruined.",0
1,Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again,0
5,Fabulous price! And the batteries work great! I'll be buying all my batteries on Amazon from now on.,1
5,Same price to buy all these as it is to buy an pack at the store. Why pay more They same to have a similar lifespan. I haven't noticed any difference.When I retire in 30 years I'll probably buy an other case to get me through my last years. But these should last until then.,1
5,Are you like me! To you have 46 devices in your home and they all seem to use of! Amazon batteries are great quality super expensive and easy to get! It never fails that you need one or two batteries at 9 am or 9 pm and don't want the haste of getting in the car for that 20 minute (or more) round trip to the drug store. A must have on the list of things worth having delivered to the house!,1
5,That's to say They're batteries and they're from Amazon. Must another staple item you'll need at a great price. Why shop anywhere else,1
5,"hey, they're batteries. They do what they are suppose to do.",1
5,I love that it comes in a box. To smart for batteries. You don't have a lot of loose batteries like you do once you open a blister pack.,1
1,Beware these batteries - I just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only 5 hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kiss !!! Fig disappointment too - won't buy this brand batteries again...nor do I recommend them to anyone out there !,0
1,"Must purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaned inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contact and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaned that the plastic and internal have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. To not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point.",0
1,I was excited to see that Amazon was allowing its name to be used on batteries as I feel that Amazon is concerned about its image. Ought these batteries and placed four of them into my camera. Took 2 RAW photo and the batteries are now dead. That a disappointment.,0
5,Amazon rocks. Great batteries at the click of a button ll!,1
5,I don't think I will ever go back to Osteo to buy batteries. The price is awesome for the quantity and they last just as long as name brand batteries.,1
1,2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charge. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.,0
5,Batteries seem fine. Hard to tell if they are as good as name brand until I use them for a while.,1
5,I haven't had these batteries long enough to tell you if they last a long time or not but for the price you can't go wrong and I trust the Amazon basic batteries to be a better value than buying Energizer or Duracell batteries online that might come from a seller who is knocking them off from China,1
2,Batteries seem to work fine but they are package in multiple of 4 and it's an annoyance to break open a new pack each time. That's the point in buying in bulk with so much packing,0
5,These seem to last just fine for games and toys. Great value.,1
1,One of first eight batteries I opened worked. Rested other batteries to confirm was a battery problem. Confirmed!!!Now.,0
5,Batteries were package good and seem fine,1
1,I change the batteries at least once a month. These things eat batteries like crazy and are hardly used.,0
2,Breaks down too fast and won't run my trail camera but around 6 hours.,0
5,"Trust Amazon Basis products. Work like the top name brand products, but at a greatly reduced price. Use these in my bike lights.",1
3,By remote wouldn't work so I took out my batteries and noticed the end of one of these batteries leaned all along one side of my remote.,0
1,"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaned all over the contact and battery holder in the thermostat.",0
1,Peaked all over our lantern battery case. I purchased these batteries for an emergency since they had a long shelf life. I put 4 batteries into each of my lanterns and 2 each into my flashlights. I have multiple battery leads between the lanterns and flashlights. I ended up spending over an hour cleaning up the battery cases and flashlights. I've purchased the AAA pack as well and don't seem to have the same problem.,0
2,"These batteries did their job but did not last very long at all. It the time of writing this I used them about two months. Normally that would be good, but I only was using them in a set of LED string lights that I kept on at most an hour a day. In the past month I barely used them at all, because the batteries had started to die and alter the color of the lights. I had expected to get a lot longer use out of them, considering other bands I only need to change every six months at earliest.",0
2,I've had several of these 'fail' long before they should have. Several instances of having to replace them much sooner that competitors batteries.,0
1,His item arrived with no battery pack. There is no way to power the toy without it because you can't just use regular batteries.,0
5,"You know, I really like the Amazon line of batteries. It first I has resistant on using anything other than Duracell, I tried these and especially for the price you simply cannot go wrong....",1
5,Battery replenishment,1
5,Easy to order easy to keep a occurring order if you tend use batteries often. I don't notice a difference between this brand or a more popular branch in terms of disability. He keep them on hand at our house because you never know when you'll need one or four of them. I'll be ordering them again soon.,1
5,great buy,1
5,These batteries are the best! I love amazon branded items!!,1
5,"Unable, long lasting, ordering again !",1
5,"They're batteries, they work that is all",1
3,"By bluetooth mouse and keyboard eat batteries, so I liked the idea of a big pack that I could just leave in my desk. These batteries are pretty useful, though, lasting only about 1/2 as long as the Duracells I get in the grocer store.",0
1,He Careful with this one - I put 4 of these into my of remote and almost immediately had one pop. I could hear a dazzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper popularity). One of the batteries was actually filling at the female end where it had split and was leaking. Unreal.... I've never had a battery do this before. I will NOT be ordering these ever again.,0
5,I installed three of these beautiful AAA cells into my bike light. Now I believe that I am less likely to die in a violent crash with a car.,1
5,High quality and quite decorative. Highly recommended.,1
2,I put these in a Pumpkin candle for Halloween and they lasted 4 days. I put them in a Blameless candle set of 5 and they lasted one week set on a time to go on for 5 hours a night. These are really not economical. West to pay the price for the good ones.,0
5,"He normally buy osteo batteries, so we don't by the Top brand anyway. It's a question of value. Of the top brand lasts to a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the best, longest lasting, battery life, and these only last to a 7 or 8 they are a great value anyway because they are 100 batteries for 22. That's just 0.22 per battery. Twenty-Two cents vs about 46 cents for the top brand is a pretty good deal in my book.Okay I might have to change batteries more often which I see is the only downside.Again it's all about value to me. These AmazonBasics AAA batteries are a bargain.",1
1,Had these in my iii for 2 weeks and the batteries leaned all over.,0
2,"I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. Of this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable bands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch.",0
1,"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Heedless to say, it scared me to death!",0
1,"Sorry to say these batteries leaned in a lighted mirror and ruined it. C'mon, Amazon!",0
5,"I have quickly become a fan of Amazon Basis products. You just can't beat the price and quality. These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase. I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good. I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Tireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic tireless mice), of remote and clocks. To far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapped can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basis as they become available.",1
5,"Super batteries, they last long. Package has so many units that I'm sharing with family and friends. Of it's Amazon you know is good.",1
5,By family goes through a lot of of and AAA batteries. I've been buying bulk packs of AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries for a few years now and my household expenditures on batteries have gone down by nearly half. I don't see any difference in the overall performance or life of these batteries when compared to Duracell or EverReady alkaline batteries and they cost quite a bit less.,1
5,"These perform and last just as well as Energizer or Duracell. He burn through these at my office for tireless keyboard and mice, so I needed to stock at a good price. I've never had any complaints by anything made by AmazonBasics at all. These come in a simple cardboard box that's sealed. Inside that box, you have two rows of sealed/wrapped batteries. They worked great for my needs, and will return based on the price.",1
1,"bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture.",0
1,"Ought these for my sisters day care. The said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received",0
5,Ought these for the holidays and I have to say I am impressed. I thought for the price I couldn't go wrong but these things hold their charge compared to any name brand. Lids have been running them in their toys non stop and they keep on going. I will definitely not hesitate to buy amazon batteries ever again.,1
5,"Is advertised, a box of 36 AAA batteries. I have a bunch in my kitchen already, from when I bought a box (36) of Duracell AAA batteries last January. Well, I guess you can never have too many. A better deal here (Amazon) than the Duracell box, hope they perform as well too. Time will tell, have a great day.",1
3,Not the longest lasting. But good for the price.,0
5,"I bought these batteries because I have had leakage problems with name branded batteries. These batteries were cheaperand seem to work well. I won't know if they leak until some time goes by,but I have had good luck with the unbrandedbatteries I purchased from Amazon in the past.",1
3,"Gros: You can get a LOT of batteries for a very cheap price!Sons: Batteries do not last very long at ALL!I don't mind changing out batteries on something I use constantly since I got the hundred back, but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week. I bought these specifically for my box One controller which is used daily for an hour or two on average.",0
2,"For some reason, they are not working very well with my tireless mouse. House pointer over very slowly when I use these batteries, but it works fine when I use different batteries",0
5,"I bought these mainly for my headphones I listen to to with in bed at night to avoid disturbing my husband. Will last about a week in those. I sometimes forget to turn them off. Haven't timed them or anything, but no particular difference noted between these and higher prices brand name batteries--are noticeably better than some more expensive ones I have bought in a pinch. Also use in bathroom scales (weigh daily) and food scales (used daily), and last a long time. Love convenience of not running out of batteries frequently.",1
3,"Not sure how long these last yet, but seem fine so far. I like the box they come in that is strong, but then they put hard plastic wrap on 4 packs of the battery that are a pain to remove. Met out your knife, don't cut yourself.",0
5,"I was sick and tired of my duracells leaking so I bought these. Only one month in, so it's hard to know if they leak, but so far so good. To complaints.",1
1,"The batteries are slightly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought of was the standard size Hope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! But of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these",0
5,"They last nearly as long as name brand, but the price is amazing. Never buying other batteries again.",1
5,"On name brand batteries usually freak me out a little, but these actually work pretty well. I drain batteries pretty fast, and so far these hold up like Duracell.",1
1,"I love Amazon. I am a prime member. Have had an amazon credit card for 16 years. Think their service and pricking is second to none.But.... these batteries are garage. War-age.They really don't work or at the very least don't work most of the time. Even when they do appear to work they only last like 1/4 of the time a normal of would. Maybe you can justify the pricking for certain situations.Should you use them for led string lights and hope they last a couple months Rep.Portable defribrilator To.of car Sure.Camera for younger sister's wedding in the Greek Isles Hope.Vibrating nose hair trimmed K.Computer battery for your 17 hour flight to Siberia Yet.Met my drift... sure try them out, and keep trying them, like I have, but don't put any faith in them.",0
1,"These are the WORST batteries I have ever encountered anywhere in my 46-year life! I am appalled that Amazon put their name on them I guarantee that if these had been my first Amazon purchase, I would never have done business here again. Of they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.One of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn't provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-lowered item to work properly. Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. One of the appliance remote would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Very item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mon had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them. I am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any battery-lowered device!!!",0
2,"His set of batteries exploded being stored in my garage, right next to a set of duracell. Duracell is fine.",0
5,great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it,1
3,These last about a week.,0
5,Great price! Batteries work great. I'm happy that I bought in bulk because I saved money and now I'm not constantly searching for batteries.,1
5,BUY THE BEST of SUFFER LIKE THE REST,1
5,your basic batteries but cheaper. Did not notice shorter life span. Great for college,1
1,Not good. On't last a week.,0
5,Awesome purchase. Last a pretty long time!,1
2,The ones that work work fine however I've just had to toss eight because they're dead. don't work. not happy,0
1,"These are wretched batteries. They typically last only two weeks in a of remote control device, they can't power a computer's mouse beyond a week, and I have serious doubts about their shelf life. Packaging is nice, though, sort of like The Washington Most.",0
1,"Had investment. Some of the batteries did not even work - no juice in them. Really surprised by the poor quality, Amazon Basis.",0
1,Terrible batteries!! They exploded all over my face. Received them on a Monday and that Sunday was having problems with my remote so I opened it up and was sprayed in the face with acid. Luckily it missed my eye. I have bought cheap batteries before and never had anything like this happen before!!,0
1,"From experience, the worst batteries I've ever purchased. Not sure if these were manufactured second hand but more than half of the pack died within ONE USE. Is a new mon who depends on the quality and longevity of a good battery for her child's needs, I will never order this product ever again.",0
5,A real pleasure.,1
5,"When I think of all of the money that I've spent so far on batteries, I am actually a bit furious! I buy batteries for all sorts of things for my family. And to think, these batteries were here all along, and I should've bought them along time ago! Amazon basis batteries are definitely worth the buy! not only do you get the size that you need when you need it, you get enough in a simple package that meets the demands that you need, easier open, and, worth the price! For the same amount of batteries that you get even in the smaller package, you would pay quite a bit more for the larger more popular bands that are out there. These batteries perform just like the others!These of been tested in everything from small toys, two Box controller. Please do not die unexplainably or unexpectedly and they just plain work!I'm ordering a larger package I think but the Subscribe and Have option is great for monthly restoring or a staple item used all the time!",1
1,I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!,0
5,Same in with a nice little package. And the batteries are high quality. I am using these for my string lights that are lowered by batteries. Everything seems pretty good so far.,1
5,"West Product Value , Amazon know what they doing (:Good price for quantity , for sure will buy more .",1
5,These work just fine.,1
5,"There are too many kiss toys to count in our house that require batteries. You cannot beat the price of Amazon branded batteries. They last just as long as any other top brand, but a much better value. AmazonBasics has quickly become a brand I trust.",1
2,"I use these for my son's Thomas and friends trains, and they didn't last very long. Maybe 2 days at the most. On't be ordering these again.",0
5,"Want beat the price, and these batteries seem to last forever even with heavy use. I grabbed this multi pack because you never know when you'll need AAA's and they've come in handy.",1
2,"Probably should have rate these one star, but I didn't because I like Amazon as a whole. These batteries are soon bad though! They were comparable to the Ireland ones at Osteo in price so I decided to switch things up and try these out. Huge mistake. These last half the life of Ireland's. Not bidding. Not worth it. These are cheap!!!!!!!!",0
1,I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to quite to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. To ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.,0
5,Always worked well in my tools and controller. Heap. Wont forget to recycle,1
5,Heap and Super convenient,1
2,Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.,0
5,The few batteries I have used so far work and are holding up. Will update if they fail premature,1
1,"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low lowered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all of batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them.",0
2,"They sure wore out quick! He normally go thou about a dozen AAA batteries in a year. He use them most for of remote and tireless houses. But we replacing these every month. I was quite amazed at how quickly they were wearing out! I have a battery checked and once they hit yellow, they were done.Heap batteries but I would not recommend nor will I buy again.",0
2,"They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does.",0
1,"These run down in my of remote quicker than any battery I have used. of says low battery within a week of installing. I will try another brand next time. Amazon, please keep an eye on quality and have your manufacturer test and give you results periodically. They will often provide good samples for evaluation early in production and then lower quality later.",0
5,Cheaper but still work well :),1
5,Works just as well as any other batteries just much cheaper!,1
1,Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality. On't last more than 3 months in a remote control (which barely uses any power). His is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the Amazon brand name.,0
5,still working fine,1
5,Product was worth the price and more,1
5,I spoil my cats rotten with toys. They burn through of bath like a lonely middle aged woman. His is the cheapest way to get them. I just wish they didn't plastic wrap them in bundles of 4.,1
2,Very nice looking in picture and from a distance but the clock itself is cheaply made....The actual clock mechanism stopped working twice and doesn't work at all now.,0
5,"Real good, Worked as soon as I put them in. But made in China. not the USA. Plump 2016.",1
1,"The positive cap is just a little shorter than it's supposed to be. That means battery holders which have shoulders built into them, the positive terminal doesn't touch the contact. The Chinese find creative ways to cut corners to achieve the desired price point of the customer. They do not sacrifice profit...they sacrifice quality...they sacrifice quantity and they sacrifice material. Thanks China!",0
5,Comparable in quality to the more expensive bands. To issues so far with the quality of this batteries. I will buy again.,1
2,These batteries held up about as well as dollar store batteries. Very disappointed in quality.,0
5,"I am a big fan of Amazon batteries! They cost less, last as long, and get here in 2 days with Crime!",1
2,"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basis battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand",0
5,Something as simple as a pack of batteries brought to you by Amazon at a more than competitive price delivered to your door. Now could you go wrong,1
3,"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store",0
5,"They're batteries, what more do I need to say",1
1,Stopped working in less than 3 months.,0
5,Batteries work as good as any other big brand,1
3,To not last as long as costo/ireland equivalent.,0
3,"These batteries seem to not last as long as other batteries I have used. They feel like they're made of good material, but they don't last as long as I would like them to.",0
5,couldn't be happier. They work great and appear to have a long life.,1
5,Amazon Basis. That's all that needs to be said:),1
1,These batteries are cap. Last a few days in box controller. Energizer lasts months. On't waste your money.,0
5,"Love this when I'm doing my make. it was a lot larger than I expected which I really loved! The only con I found is that it is TOO BRIGHT. When I first used it, my eyes and head hurt because of the brightness. But overall, this is a great product.",1
1,"of NOT PURCHASE! These batteries leaned in a machine I was using in my kiss room to project stars on the ceiling. When I picked the protector up, it leaned battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs. It could have gotten on my children! The leaking fluid also ruined the protector.The batteries were new, stored at room hemp, used at room hemp, not charged, and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions. Disposing in the appropriate manner.ETA: I was VERY happy with Amazon's resolution despite this bad experience. Thanks Amazon... I'll order batteries from you again. Must not your brand...",0
5,"Of you, like me, dont care what batteries you use in your of remote these are fine for yours-Am 100 batteriesThey come in packs of 4, so not loose batteries rolling aroundCons-I hear they may drain quicker than more expensive batteries. To that I say: I have 99 more where that came from.",1
1,Must put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.,0
1,"With four kiss under the roof, their toys are always in need of of batteries. I had purchased this AmazonBasics pack of of batteries for exactly that purpose. The expiration year reads 2024, but after just two years of sitting on the shelf, the batteries that are left are all but dead. They weren't left in cold storage to freeze, they were right on the shelf in our living room. I ended-up going to Radio Hack and purchasing one of their batteries instead.I can only imagine that most of the 5-star reviews for this product are based off initial impressions and short-term use. It's really sad that they just can't hold their own after only two years. Will stick with known bands from now on.",0
1,Ought a box of 36 ana batteries and all batteries were dead. On't waste your money. The only way I rate it one star is because it would not except ZERO stars which is what this product deserves.,0
1,One of these batteries had a full charge. By charge detector never reached the green zone. They were one half used up. His was true for the other two sizes D and AAA.,0
1,All the batteries came dead. One of them worked. On't bother buying these.,0
1,"I got two of these batteries with my Fire of stick. Loaded them in and everything was good for 1.5 days. When the Fire of stick stopped responding. I trouble shouted with no fix. Called customer service and they had me trouble shoot too, started by saying can you change the batteries.... my response ... seriously, you want me to change the batteries, it's a breaking of stick what could possibly be wrong, the batteries are brand new and came with the device. To I was changing the batteries as I was saying all that only for the new batteries to fix the problem. To.... these amazon batteries died in 1.5 days. Now does that happen",0
1,It's seems as thought all of the batteries in the package are already dead. They are only lasting 3-4 days in the devices I'm putting them in. Fairly disappointed,0
1,"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that most the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energies lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energies lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last six as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window.",0
3,Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.,0
1,"The batteries were not operable out of the package. Thought it was the appliance, but replaced with other batteries and it worked fine. Luckily, Amazon's return policy is amazing but I doubt I'll try another one of their Basis brand items daytime soon.",0
5,Perfect,1
3,"These work pretty well. They don't seem to last quite as long as Duracell or Energizer, but for the price I will continue to buy.",0
3,decent batteries. ok life.,0
5,"It's now about the middle of April and I bought these at the end of February, I waited to post my review so I could get a better feel for these and how they last and how they compare to other batteries I've been using.He use a lot of batteries in our house so I buy bulk and these seemed like a good deal and they were or are.These seem to last just as long as other batteries I've used in terms of usage time so no complaints there at all. I'm happy with them for sure, will purchase again as needed.",1
5,Recent batteries,1
5,"I bought these solely based on price. (Right have even been a Crime May special, I'm not positive at this point)Use them in remote, my camera flash, and a few flashlights. I think they work just fine and last an appropriate amount of time. Of it seems they were used up quickly, I just think about the price I paid and have no issues.",1
5,These are okay by me.,1
5,Seems to have lifespan of other name brand batteries. Happy with them,1
3,They dont last as long as certain premium bands but they do of. I wouldn put them in critical apes like smoke detector but for of remote and toys and all the other good modern distractions that regularly beg for was they are of.,0
3,"Not the best, not the worst. Less life than some batteries but price is right.",0
5,Decided to try these private labelled batteries and they work excellency. I have already purchased more of a different size.,1
1,Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast.,0
1,"He must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. To much for 10 year shelf life.",0
1,"Defective! All Amazon batteries I tried over the past year have been defective. Most too short. I have to constantly pull the spring, if the device has the spring, and roll the battery around to get it to work again. These are new batteries. Any of the batteries were thrown away because we thought they had been used up. It wasn't until recently that we realized it was all the Amazon batteries that were causing the problem. I was on the phone with Amazon for two hours yesterday trying to get these orders straighten that out. I still have no confirmation that I do not have to send the batteries back because many went into the trash.",0
1,"I am now trying to use the batteries and basically they are not working. Perhaps they are old, but they are just plain not working. I put in a Duracell and my headphones work. I put any one of the 36 batteries in the headphones - and it is not working. It is not worth the effort to get my 10 back.",0
5,The price is fantastic and they work just as well as certain name brand batteries with the copper top and the funny.,1
5,"AAA batteries. They make things go. I, up...I have nothing else. I mean, batteries are pretty much--Oh, wait! They're quite shiny also.",1
5,I'll never buy Collar Tore batteries again! D They're great. I'd put them on par with Energizer or Duracell.,1
5,You can not beat the price and it is by a trusted name.,1
5,"Great product at a great price! I have been using these alongside the more name-brand batteries, and so far they are still neck and neck! I'm always looking for a quality product at a great price, and I really feel like these have the longevity to do that. I'm very pleased, and we will be buying Amazon batteries as our household battery moving forward.",1
1,"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. .",0
1,Batteries dead as of June 1. I did not use half of then. Good for 6 months.,0
1,"He used in an August smart lock. He expected to get about 2-3 months of use based on the energies batteries that came with the lock, but batteries died in 2 weeks.",0
1,DID NOT RECIEVE of I only received Batteries!,0
2,I bought these for remote in my home. I'm constantly having to change them and sometimes the brand new batteries don't work.,0
3,"I used these in tireless microphone in church. They didn't last as long as I expected. Actually, rechargeable batteries do nearly as well.",0
1,Ve gone thou half the box. Everyone of these batteries lasted for about 10 minutes and then died. Not happy at all! Lasted money on something i needed.,0
1,"I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand.",0
2,"These batteries die out a lot faster than the Duracell batteries we normally purchase. Yes, they are cheaper, but unfortunately more batteries are ending up in the handbills because we are going through these too fast.",0
1,"They didn't last long, do not waste your money!! Lie quickly, most of them didn't even work out of the package!!",0
1,"I ordered these thinking they were a great price, but sadly they die very quickly.",0
1,these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my of thermostat which is battery lowered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energies - they last for at least a few most. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.,0
1,these batteries died very quickly when compared to energies or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.,0
1,run out super quick! would not buy again,0
2,"Folds basically a 30 minute steady usage charge and dies. He used these in microphone, and they died within the 30-40 minute range, fully charged.It also seems that the older they get, the longer it takes to charge and the faster they die out. Not very reliable, unfortunately.",0
1,Heap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Man brand again.,0
2,Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted.,0
2,To not hold charge as well as major bands.,0
1,Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it,0
2,"I love Amazon, but these aren't at the same level as the big bands. I use them in some monitoring devices in my home. Typically I would need to change these every 3 months, but these are lasting about 6-7 weeks at best. They're ok, but just don't have the life expectancy I need.",0
1,these batteries are terrible very disappointed. i have purchased before great long lasting very powerful. i must have received a bad batch they don't last very long. i may not purchase again.,0
1,"Worked for one day, then stopped working. An't tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn't register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend.",0
2,Disappointed with this product. Used them for led candles and had to wriggle them around to get them to work. It the same time I also purchase ACDelco Batteries because Amazon would only allow the purchase of one box. I'm glad I did because the ACDelco batteries worked great! I would not purchase AmazonBasics batteries again.,0
3,Batteries are notably less long-lived compared to other bands. Disappointed!,0
1,The price was right but they just don't last as long as the other name brand batteries so it's not worth it.,0
1,Badly these batteries are horrible! I hardly ever have complaints about anything I order but these batteries barely have any power and I've had to change them out many times.,0
1,"These batteries literally only last 15 minutes inside of each device I put them in. When I researches the product, they told me the only way was to spend 50 on the recharger for these batteries. I personally do not buy batteries to have to spend more than what I spent on them in whole to have to buy a whole other product to charge them. Worst amazon product I ever wasted my money on",0
1,"These batteries were a huge disappointment. I used two in my amazon to remote and they lasted only 2 weeks. Usually, I only need to change batteries in that remote every 3-4 months or so. Total trepoff.",0
1,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Had, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. When I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. Of I was home, I would have used my battery peter. To 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fan, but not this time.",0
2,"For some reason, these just haven't held a charge the way the Duracells I've used the past do. I've used these in those small-wired-LED lights you can use for decorations. Those lights take 3 of batteries and while the old Duracells I've used lasted several months on a 4-hour on, 16 hour-off time, these are lasting just a few weeks.",0
1,These batteries are not lasting at all.... very short life on them... super disappointed...,0
2,Batteries don't last that long I bought these for some of the little round lights that go in your closes or under your cabinet they didn't make it a week which was sad.,0
1,Spend a few more dollars and get a branded one. These discharge very fast. Had to keep changing my wall clock battery every 2 months when I had these. Not an energies battery and that stayed for more than a year. Didn't expect amazon product to be of such poor quality.,0
5,Ought several times and they last,1
5,Great Batteries. Most and shipping was well worth it.,1
1,"of NOT BUY. All batteries arrived completely dead. I thought it might be a bad batch. Ordered more, all arrived dead.",0
1,"I only have it one star because I couldn't give zero stars. Over half of the box were dead. The ones that did work, only worked for a very short time. To not buy these batteries.",0
1,They didn't work. Took one from each pack and - nothing!,0
1,"Went to pit them on for the first time and the strap behind the buckle broke. Never even got to wear them. Door construction, cheaply made product.",0
1,You get what you pay for.Lucky to get 2 weeks of minimum use.,0
1,They went Head before even using them.. The ones i used lasted maybe hours at best !!!,0
1,Right as well be dead on arrival. Already burned through two sets of 4 of these since I ordered them less than two months ago on a Schlage keypad deadbolt lock. The previous batteries lasted over a year. I'll never order another Amazon basis battery.,0
1,"Purchased these 3 months ago in addition to a higher end () brand that came with a 9 pocket charge. The higher end rechargeables are still going strong. These leaned battery acid all over my charge and ruined one pocket, and ruined an under cabinet pack light. Have your money! They won't last!",0
1,Ought these batteries thinking they were a good price. I have two deodorizer devices that spray a tiny amount every :20 minutes. I put these batteries in one and a brand name in the other. The name brand batteries have not been changed yet ant these batteries have gone through 4 pairs. Same brand are cheaper in the long run,0
5,"To not have issues with their batteries and definitely cheaper than the regular store, the only other store that compares is Area.",1
1,I don't understand why these are rate so highly - these batteries of NOT LAST. I have never experienced batteries that died so quickly....I used them from everything to my computer mouse to microphone and they lasted maybe about 1/4 the time of what I'm used to. I guess you get what you pay for - would never order these again,0
1,They do not last long at all. I have to keep changing them out on the products I put them in. Will not be buying them again.,0
2,batteries last a fraction of the time that most of the other well known battery bands do,0
1,I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a time. He are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. To not recommend.,0
1,They do not work. I had to buy Duracell,0
1,These batteries started leaking right out of the box.I threw them in the trash and went back to Duracell.,0
3,Medium disability. Donna buy Duracell in future. To you have great quality rechargeables,0
5,"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Palmar (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right Of you are like me and have 3 kiss that all have annoying gizmos and electronic cap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my would thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.His may sound work-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remote, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be lowered.",1
1,DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. That a disappointment. Threw them away. :(,0
1,I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.,0
1,Literally the worst battery I've ever had. I've used them in different types of products and they are DEAD WITHIN A WEEK every time. To to the dollar tree and save yourself some money and a headache,0
3,They are ok batteries. I use them on my remote and have to switch out frequently.,0
2,Does not last. Very short life span.,0
5,Batteries last a decent amount for things like toys and remote. The packages come 4 each in a plastic wrap so you don't have to worry about loose batteries floating around after you open the box.,1
5,"I didn't conduct an official experiment, but they seem to work just as good as any other batteries out there. Perfect!",1
5,Does the job. Very good price!,1
5,good price good batteries,1
5,These are batteries so what can one say. ...they are economical and function. I bought light motion that require 3 AAA batteries. I needed 9 and they all work fearlessly. Plus now my remote control also works too.,1
1,After one use in a regular used battery lowered item it's dead. With other brand I can use the item several times before I have to replace the battery.,0
2,I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Must basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Grand name has lasted 2 months.,0
1,These die of fast.,0
1,"But these batteries in led string lights on two wreaths, place ireland batteries in another set of the same lights....guess what Amazon batteries loose their power quickly. Ireland batteries are still flashing strong,,,,,,Amazon batteries barely blink. Sorry Amazon, love you but not these for me.",0
3,doesn't work with everything. baby toys good. electronics not so much,0
2,It doesn't work with my Amazon tireless mouse,0
5,Works for the purpose purchased.,1
5,Great value. Deep the power just the same as the much higher prices Duracell and Energizer batteries,1
5,"Haven't noticed any difference in performance since I switch from my (brand name), big difference in price though. I will be ordering these from now on.",1
1,These go dead very quickly. Not worth it if you rely on whatever the batteries are lowering. Maybe ok for a remote control or something unimportant.,0
1,Didn't have hardly any charge to them. A total waste of money.,0
1,These batteries don't even work in a Amazon Firestick!,0
1,"On't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my tireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results.",0
5,Why spend more on other brand name batteries when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they work really well.,1
1,"Worst batteries for photographer. I'm sure they might be fine for using around the house, but for what I purchased them for (using with my external flash) these are the worst batteries I've ever used.On't purchase them again.The black ones that are supposed to be better are also horrible for photographer.Household use only.",0
1,"Never put a review online about a purchase , but this Amazon battery leak so badly I have to discard all of them after 2 weeks of use, DON'T BUY THIS ITEM ....",0
1,"These are, by, far, the worst batteries my family has ever purchased. They have all lasted less than one week and I've only used them in things that see usage a few times per week. One of them have seen more than 10 min total usage before needing replaced and q about a third of them have leaned or borrowed worthless a few days. I've had much better luck with dollar store bands.",0
2,"I use it for the rou remote and it runs out so fast, holds for about 2-3 weeks (just like the chinese batteries),",0
1,"You get what you pay for here. These are cheap batteries and don't last very long, I'd spend the extra and get rechargeables.",0
1,I put two of these in my small flashlight and they only lasted about 15 minutes. Haste of money.,0
3,On't hold a charge as long as other comparable batteries,0
1,"I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use.",0
5,"On't know why I waited so long to finally invest in rechargeable batteries. Once you switch, you won't go back!",1
2,Good price but batteries just don't last as long as name bands. By hope was to power Christmas decorations through the holidays and save a few bucks. Any of these batteries did not make it. In the future I will stick with prove bands.,0
1,"Terrible. On't hold their charge, I change the batteries in my remote once a week. Will not be buying again.",0
1,These are terrible. On't last But then in various items and their life is only 1/2 half of a Duracell,0
1,"These have failed after a few weeks each time I've used them in my tireless keyboard. Duracells, on the other hand, have lasted for months.",0
3,I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. He will continue to buy them though because of the price.,0
1,"His is my and time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely package, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train.",0
1,I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.,0
1,Batteries do not last at all. North just getting energies batteries instead.,0
2,"After using two sets of these, I am going to agree with other reviews and say that they don't last as long as name brand batteries.",0
3,"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energies, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock.",0
1,These batteries don't last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get.,0
1,"These batteries don't last. They might be a good value but for me it's more important to have a battery that lasts longer. Or use these for hiding and rockclimbing and working on my car in the middle the night if I have a flat tire. Of you use them like that you want a much better battery like the name bands Duracell, energies etc. Of you just want something that's cheap these batteries are definitely cheap but I bought the 60 count Duracell batteries for .36 each. I think the Amazon ones go for just a bit over .20 each. I think the Duracell's last more than a third longer.",0
5,On't look further for any other brand. You get double the amount of batteries for the same price compared to other bands. The battery life is comparable to the other name bands. Must have for every household.,1
5,long lasting/good price,1
1,They lasted less than 24 hours in my mouse and that includes turning the mouse off overnight! That a trepoff.,0
1,"I bought these batteries to charge my insult pump - a life critical device. After I started using them, I found my pump worked terribly and after testing all other variable, popped out the Amazon battery and replaced with a Duracell, and everything was back to normal. I won't use these again.",0
5,"Great value for batteries in bulk - our household expends batteries quickly, so it's great to always have a back supply.The low cost of these means I can afford to keep plenty on hand. The quality is comparable to most other bands we've tried - especially for video game controller and the like.",1
1,"I am very disappointed in these. I put them in my remote and within 24 his they are completely dead. For shame, Amazon. For shame.",0
5,I'm never going to buy a brand-name battery again . Amazon basic batteries are just as good as the big boys . Amazon basic batteries are my battery of choice from now on .,1
2,"On't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detector with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detector. On't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product.",0
2,"I use a lot of batteries for lighted decorations all year round. I tried these out during Halloween. They were the worst. I tested them against Dams Club batteries, Harbor Freight Tools batteries and duracell. The amazon always died first. They even leaned that battery acid out after a few hours of use. Must horrible. I removed these from my subscribe and save list. I won't buy again.",0
1,These are horrible! On't waste your money. These batteries die faster than any I've ever tried. A few hours in a Iii remote and they have to be replaced. I'm so disappointed!,0
2,The original Amazon Basis in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use.,0
1,"I like shopping with Amazon and have purchased several Amazon brand products. However, I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Have your self the headache and buy energies or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I'm out the money.",0
2,they dont last long at all not worth buying,0
5,A Great Real In Great Batteries.,1
3,dont last as long as I expected them to. they are in our fire stick remote and i have to change them about every 2 or 3 months,0
3,"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to charge them and it leaned all over my battery charge. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. To if I were you, don't charge them",0
1,Worst battery I have ever came across. On't use for children's toys leads battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaned battery acid all over.,0
1,"Ought a, c d iv batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope iv work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't worked c batteries they lasted 12 of a of Amazon batteries are horrible",0
5,"Exactly what I needed, lots of of batteries for a cheap price. They last just as long as any other battery so this was totally worth it. Will only buy my batteries from here now on.",1
1,These batteries don't last!!!!,0
1,All but about 4 were buds. That a waste of money.,0
2,Not very long lasting batteries....,0
5,I was surprised to see how expensive these batteries were and package nice,1
2,"These batteries are HYPED! Duracell always wins. I bought them for electronic circuit for my experiments and I can clearly see how they fail against Duracell AAA batteries. I also wonder about the review someone has put that shows the performance plots. Under standard conditions doesn't matter, batteries need to perform the way consumers use them. To be fair, these batteries are better but don't show them as the best in the world, no way!",0
5,"Considering that Duracell batteries are guaranteed to leak and ruin your device, these are an excellent alternative.",1
1,"Ought these in late Sov. By March 1, most of them were dead in the package.",0
5,"Works well, easy packing",1
5,"Batteries for days, easy and cheap. Of they simply work, I'll be all good. The packing is shiny, so they will, right :)",1
5,"The Internet of Things... more like, Internet of Batteries! The more smart gear we get, the more batteries we blow through. When my wife-enabled scale (!) popped out after about 9 months on the factory batteries, I restored it with the Amazon Basis. They ship in a compact, no-fills cardboard box... inside a larger Amazon shipping box. The cardboard box is easy to open... no screwing around with scissors and sharp plastic packing. When you can close the lid on them when done and not worry about them rolling everywhere. Of you have shake hands or poor eyesight, these are the ones to get.",1
5,"Arrived quickly. Easy to install with clear, simple instructions. Touch screen input seems to be the same as it was prior to installation.",1
5,Works as well as the name brand batteries but so much cheaper! Easy to unpack also.,1
5,Plug and play! Easy to use.,1
5,Would highly recommend. Such cheaper than traditional calm-shell battery packs in store and seem to have a decent shelf life.,1
5,He are pleased with these AAA batteries. They are economical and have worked well for us in the items we tried them with. Easy to store in the cardboard box they arrived in.,1
5,Must as good as the more expensive name bands.,1
3,Does not last as long as name bands such as Duracell and Energizer.,0
5,"Heap and effective, These batteries last a reasonable amount of time for the price",1
5,Such a great deal on efficient batteries. By kiss use batteries like crazy on their leap pads . I've tried several store bands and big brand names. These last as well as a Duracell and we're so much better prices.,1
2,"I gave one star because they were batteries and did not explode in my face which is a major plus. However, if you need batteries for anything you use on a daily basis outside a to remote then do not buy. These batteries do not last as long as duracell or energies by far, and i wish i was getting paid to say that. Spend the extra dollars and buy a better battery.",0
5,"Must enough batteries to fill all the remote and have a few in reserve.And, hey, it's Amazon - you can't beat the price.",1
5,Dynamic Strong Battery.,1
5,"Works great and cheaper than at big box stores! He have lots of shameless candles, so these are great",1
5,It's a whole cap load of A batteries. They make electricity happen. It's magic,1
3,Their batteries,0
5,Of your looking for batteries of the future that are environmental safe you need only look for in batteries they put out more power and last much longer and are rechargeable. AGAIN THEY ARE ENVIRONMENTALY SAFE. Check out 1.vol batteries in.. much better battery then anything out there.!! of your customers a favor and bring them up to date with new technology.. FACT!!!!!!!!!!PLEASE HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND USE A MUCH BETTER BATTERY in,1
5,"These work as well as any big name brand batteries. I'm a heavy pp user since I work from home and I use a tireless mouse with my lawton. I can get weeks of use out of these without an issue. And even when the low battery light starts flashing on the mouse, I still get 2-3 days use out of them. Have your money, and buy these instead.",1
5,"Why people buy batteries at the store any more is beyond me. The price on these can't be beat and they last as long as the name brand batteries. Even better they show up at your door, leaving you do spend time doing things you want to do.",1
5,"Blown away by the affordability of these batteries. Even if they're slightly supper in length of useful life, it's STILL a killer deal.",1
5,Even though there not bank brand batteries they last a while use two out of the pack and it's still going for about a month,1
5,Very battery had a voltage reading between 1.61 and 1.iv. Will update if the lifespan of these batteries is less than expected.,1
5,K people. Everyone knows how it is when you've run out of double A's. I added these to my subscribesave. They seem to last a fair amount of time (even in the game boy!). Very household needs a good tache of double A's hidden somewhere. The price is very unfordable too. Great buy.,1
5,"batteries.. everybody need them.. these are everybit as good as duracell for half the price, better than energies .... very satisfied I use them for professional audit and photography...",1
5,"Everyone discusses the pro and sons of batteries. They lasted 1.2 hours less than brand A or .34 hours longer than brand B.Whatever. They're necessary. They're cheaper than some, more expensive than some. if you're buying 300 batteries a week.......Law bah..... I have these in my flashlights. I have lots of flashlights. I don't have to go to the store. More than enough for a positive rating.",1
5,Proper sized (unlike genetic batteries) with lots of power.,1
5,These batteries are soon much cheaper than the name bands and function the exact same. I use a lot of batteries with my Box controller and saw no difference in battery life between these and name bands. Will absolutely buy more in the future,1
5,Exactly as described. I'll learn if they last or not.,1
5,Wonderful batteries! These batteries are great and last a long time.,1
5,Excellent,1
5,A great product! Why pay more for batteries when these work just fine and are cheap! Thanks Amazon!,1
5,Excellent,1
5,Excellent,1
5,Excellent,1
5,Excellent - not sure why I would ever pay more for batteries.,1
5,Excellent batteries. An't complain! A lot cheaper than any other bands and you get the same good quality. Amazon doesn't disappoint.,1
5,"Excellent set of batteries, very unfordable, and comes with a nice packing. I won't be buying batteries from retail stores anymore.",1
5,"Great batteries and great price. Thanks Amazon (and by the way, if you're listening, please make an entire Amazon Basis store so Crime Members can shop in there exclusively).",1
5,Great price for batteries with exceptional performance and life.,1
5,"i now use of and AAA amazon batteries, great price, same quality as name bands.",1
5,The price is unbearable! Never buying batteries at CVS again,1
5,These Amazon Basic batteries are just as good as the expensive name brand. I'll be buying these from now on.,1
5,"Unbearable for the price. Haven't tested in depth, but seem to last just as long as any name brand of's.",1
5,Excellent for the price. I usually buy Duracell for the guns and their video game controller -- these last just as long and saved us some .. came in a box that was great for storage and batteries were also vacuum packed by 4's inside the cardboard box. Will buy again,1
5,His is an excellent phone case. Give star sleek look and perfect fit.,1
5,Satisfied will recorder,1
5,"They work great and come in excellent packing!I can't touch for their lifespan vs the big bands, since I haven't paid attention to how long my old batteries would last. It's at least comparable! Comparable enough that the discount on AmazonBasics batteries is definitely worthwhile!",1
5,Excellent Batteries,1
5,"Good Price, excellent packing, and the batteries last a long time in comparison with other brand batteries I have tried that only came with four in the pack for the same price! Will order these from now on from Amazon!!",1
5,"Great batteries, great price!!",1
5,Great price and lasts just as long as leading bands of batteries.,1
5,Great product for its value. Amazon isn't doing things just because Amazon does things because they are needed by customers and this is just small example of that.,1
5,I shouldn't be since it's amazon. But there as good as name bands. I'll buy from now on. Have selfish money,1
5,"But 4 of these in my handed scanned 2 weeks ago, still going strong. I normally leave it on between 1 to 3 hours at a time. To say I'm beyond impressed is an understatement. But of normal alkaline batteries, I was getting at best 2 or 3 days.",1
5,Superior to Dura C batteries. I compared new batteries of each brand in the same flashlight. Amazon batteries were brighter.,1
5,These are done long lasting batteries. They work great,1
5,These batteries work great!!!,1
5,Works as described,1
5,You can never have too many batteries. These last a long time.,1
5,"These batteries are most likely made by a third party with some experience in manufacturing private label. They are well made, lasts long (cannot tell significant difference between these and the brand name ones). I also like the convenience of having them shipped to me as I don't relish shopping for batteries at physical stores. Made in Indonesia.",1
5,"Throw away all my genetic batteries and replaced with these. 48-Back came in a nice carbon box with 4-pus. battery in each plastic wrap. Used in remote controller, game controller, mouse, automatic spray air freshness, LED flashlights and camping lanterns, clocks, wall lamps, and other devices. Excellent batteries for the price.",1
5,Excellent batteries with a long shelf-life.,1
5,"Excellent batteries, at a good price.",1
5,Love the product and the price.Batteries work great. I love that I can keep extra on hand. Batteries come in either brown sturdy box or plastic box.,1
5,"These work great. Expensive, and from a name you can trust!",1
5,Excellent batteries! Last just as long if not longer than the name bands. These are what I'll be purchasing from now on.,1
5,"I needed AAA batteries and it's going to be a while before I get to Osteo to get some. I was buying something else on Amazon and decided to get some batteries, to give it a chance. They arrived in 2 days, they were well package and sealed, and most importantly, they work great, they hold a charge well, I am very pleased. Excellent batteries.",1
5,They're definitely good batteries! That a bargain. I recommend this if you have a lot of AAA toys.,1
5,of batteries- good quality can't beat the value.,1
5,Excellent batteries. Long lasting in small MP3 player.,1
5,"using them in our trail can, excellent battery life",1
5,"These are your standard of batteries that are very similar to most other of batteries you will find at most stores. The energy output is quite similar however the price on Amazon is a lot cheaper than what you can find in the store. For that reason I really like using these batteries from Amazon Basis. They are cheap and they last an acceptable amount of time for a cheap battery.Dimensions and close-up can be seen in the photo I have attached to the review.Included in this set are 48 batteries that are shrink wrapped in groups of 4.Gros:*Good amount of power output*Last an acceptable amount of time*Awesome priceCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:These batteries are not rechargeable. They are one-time use. Of you need a rechargeable battery you will need to look elsewhere.Overall: 5/5 stars (.5 rounds up, .5 rounds down) 5 stars you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible.",1
5,These work just as well as the top battery bands.,1
5,"Excellent cells for the price range. From what I see, they are as good as Duracells and that is all I ever used to use.The packing is amazing. Only in China can they still pack in cardboard boxes that surround the package like this.I am not doing any testing, other than use in low lowered items like tireless mice, keyboard, wall clocks and the like. That's all I need them for. These cells meet those requirements and that's all I care about. For high volume stuff I use NiMHs, but you just can't beat the price. I am finding that many of the Amazon basis products are a hit. I have bought several things and all have worked just as good or better than the higher prices competition. Good job Amazon.",1
5,Great value,1
5,North the money. Used these batteries while camping for two weeks and they are still working great. They will probably be used at home or used again next year during our camping adventure.,1
5,West deal I have found!,1
5,"Excellent batteries, I couldn't believe how expensive they were. I will continue to purchase Amazon batteries from now on. I use these in my video gazing controller daily and they last for a long time. Very happy that I purchased these and would recommend to anyone!",1
5,"Vice and fresh, dated 10 years out! I use these in everything, should last a long time.",1
5,Excellent item! Works great and is exactly as pictured in the description,1
5,"I've used these as a replacement for the nearly double in price of Duracell batteries. These last just as long as the Duracell batteries - a minute or two does not make a difference as my devices are on 24/7 - especially when these batteries are half the price! I have not had any leak, whether they were in their package or in any devices. The expiration dates on every shipment I've had so far have averaged 9 years with some 10 years from when I received them. His means they are fresh (recently made) and haven't been sitting around on a warehouse shelf for long. I like the green circular negative (-) indicator with the check mark (tick) on the side. Takes for quick installation in poor light. Excellent value and excellent performance!",1
5,"Excellent power and price. You can't beat this deal on high quality batteries. Even the club warehouse prices for their own store bands are more expensive than these.They provide more than adequate power for everything we've used them for.They work very good for small flashlights too.Seriously. You are not going to find a better deal for high quality, reliable alkaline batteries anywhere.",1
5,"Like most people I use tons of batteries. The super high price and haste of the marketing and nomenclature of buying them at the store is removed by buying these Amazon battery packs. More and more I am realizing that when possible it's a good idea to go with the 'Amazon Basis' products (especially for items like batteries). Certainly there are premium batteries that I have trusted for years and will continue to purchase. But I have found no difference between these Amazon batteries and my favorite other bands. To instead of buying 2 or 5 packs of batteries while waiting to check out in the store think about getting a realistic quantity of excellent batteries for half the price (maybe not half, but certainly less than name bands).",1
5,WORK GREAT,1
5,"Excellent price and they last for a long time. Have not had one leak either, like the other brand I use to use.",1
5,"I haven't tested the duration of the power from the battery, but the price, quality of shipping, quality it of the batteries are Excellent.",1
5,"I have used expensive dollar store batteries in the past. I became curious about the actual performance data of cheap vs. name brand batteries, and discovered that essentially you pay approximately the same amount per unit of power, regardless of battery (with the exception of lithium ion which cost more per unit of power). Also, I noticed that the cheap batteries did not work as well as name brand with my automatic wine bottle opened. To, if I am going to pay the same amount of unit power per battery, why not get the ones I have to change the least was pleasantly surprised to find these amazon basis batteries at a cost per battery that is significantly lower than name bands, but with similar performance characteristics as the name bands. Assuming the marketing information is accurate, these batteries should last a long time, and not cost much. His is an ideal combination in my opinion.",1
5,"Excellent price, and they are long-lasting batteries. I have no interest in purchasing batteries from anywhere else from now on.",1
5,"Good price, good quality and shipping time much less expensive than at the local drugstore. will buy again..",1
5,"Excellent batteries, work well, price is right. Cannot tell difference between these and the name brand.",1
2,Good price but batteries don't last long compared to other bands,0
5,I cannot believe what a great deal these are!!! These work just as well as any other name brand battery. I have a two-year-old and therefore we go through a LOT of batteries for his toys. I will never buy any other battery again!!!,1
3,"These are fair batteries. They are fine for most toys, etc. but they don't seem to last as long as Duracell or Energizer batteries. And I've found some of the packs to be hit or miss. I've had a few packs with several of the batteries already nearly drained straight out of the package.",0
1,I was searching for rechargeable batteries and these came up. I did think it was a great price for rechargeable batteries so I bought two packs. Didn't realize they were regular batteries until they arrived. I was a little annoyed. I blame Amazon for showing me these when I was looking for something else.,0
1,"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kiss can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels.",0
5,Fantastic batteries for a fantastic price! High quality. Shipping was super fast as I received them the next day after ordering. Happy customer,1
5,"Give stars.They all worked, there were lots of them, and they didn't cost a lot.I like that they are package four per set in the big box, so there weren't just batteries EVERYWHERE!",1
5,"I didn't even know amazon made batteries until I worked at an event where there were remote control cars for kiss to play with and these batteries lasted a long time. In a 5 hour period I think we only went through 2 sets of batteries per car.. and these things were running non stop! That sold me on their quality, so I bought a box for the house!",1

5,"Finally decent batteries at an even more decent price. Will definitely be coming back when I run out. Only thing I'd change is the packing, but I'd rather the price stay where it is as the packing isn't that big of a deal",1
2,"Had to wait for more than a month for delivery. First few uses of product has not been good. In a head set had to replace batteries (3) with very small usage, evenings only, had to already replace batteries. The AAA pro cells we normally order usually last a week or better with daily use. I am not pleased with this product.",0
3,"First one out of the box I placed in a Swissphone Fire department paper. Battery indicator had 3 levels, and a new battery only shows 2 bars. That's rather disappointing, I should have stuck with Duracell, they show full charge.",0
2,I used it in a computer key board. First pair lasted only half of the time of other brand like DURACELL.I will see if the second pair does any better.,0
5,First time purchase. I have just started using them. Seem to be a quality product. I will have to see how long they last.,1
3,"The price is very acceptable, however, feed backs on file indicate these may be a trade-off for shorter life usage. One review stated having experienced battery content leakage. In any event evaluation must be based on individual usage over a reasonable length of time, so I'll reserve my decision on re-orders after first order usage",0

3,For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem,0
5,For the price you can't beat these. I have never had any issues with them. They last long and work well.,1
1,"When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazon frustration free packing you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly package amazon product I've ever seen.",0
2,"Never again will I purchase this. The outer cardboard box is frustration-free, but the batteries are tightly shrink-wrapped in groups of four. You need to cut into the wrap to begin to separate the batteries, pull them apart, then cut a little slice into the wrap around each battery. When figure out how to pull each battery out of its little, plastic strait-jacket.Even if these batteries function well, the haste of wrapping them (12 shrink-wrapped sets of four batteries) isn't worth any cost savings.",0

Nothing I put these batteries work properly whether of, AAA, C or D, not the blood pressure cup won't fill with air before going into Error, motion lights that flicked when these are put in, remote that work on and off - which all goes away with name brand batteries!",0
1,"When I purchased the Fire Stick, these batteries were included. In less than three weeks they were dead and had to be replaced. The batteries for the Fire Stick are used only in the remote, so it is not as though they got much use! I would never recommend such a garage product.",0
2,Feel like these loose their charge much faster than the brand I used to buy. Will not purchase in the future.,0
5,Great buy,1
5,great value..,1
5,Great. Batteries,1
5,Works great. All I use now. Order a big pack of these,1
2,On't last very long,0
5,"Great batteries, great price. Aorta love Amazon!",1
3,Great price but not long lasting in comparison to higher prices competitors. I got about 1/5 of the life I would with Duracell.,0
5,The amount you get is better paid for the quantity and quality you get from like target or another store.I personally love it and haven't really made a went into it :),1
3,There batteries do not last as long as Am's or Osteo brand batteries.,0
1,Ought a 20 pack to give them a try and found they dont hold up well in the to remote.... gone back to duracells,0
5,Are as good as any on market and price is better.,1
5,Been using them for blameless candles Work well.,1
3,"Good price but I can't tell if these last as long as Duracell. AmazonBasics with Amazon Crime are a great deal though, and I'd probably buy them again. I haven't had any problems with corrosive or other concerns.",0
5,Amazon labelled batteries are always excellent.,1
3,"These batteries work great but they don't last as long as name brand batteries but that's ok. He mostly bought them for my toller's toys and they work well enough for that!-Is a wife and as a mon of 3 kiss, I spend a lot of time shopping for deals on the best products out there for my family. It's important to me that if we're spending our hard earned money that we get a top notch product in return. I often rely on the reviews and opinions of others when contemplation purchasing a new product that I haven't tried before myself. Because of that, any products that I buy (whether on Amazon or from a rd party) I always make sure to leave a detailed review of the product to help others when selecting items to purchase, as well. By family tests these products fully before forming a solid opinion and writing a review. When I write a review, I keep in mind that those reading are also looking for honesty about the product and want an unbiased opinion to go by. Of my review has been helpful to you, please give me a Yes vote on my review. Thank you!",0
5,"Buying batteries is a summer, Amazon makes it less painful. we like to keep a lot on hand as just about everything takes a a battery. I haven't noticed any difference between these and the more expensive brand. money saved is a win!",1
3,"I have not had them long but they seem to be doing the job that is required. I will check back in later to discuss battery life if I remember. I will say, that I could have found batteries a bit cheaper around town and on the internet so I probably will not buy these again for this reason.",0
3,Maybe a great value but many in the pack are DOA.,0
5,Is described,1
5,best way to buy,1
3,"These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They work, but like other reviews are saying, they don't last as long as other bands or rechargeable batteries. Of you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less.",0
5,"basic battery. very basic, good for basic people.",1
3,Must regular of batteries at a decent price.,0
5,Good price. I didn't notice any super long-lasting abilities. Must your typical battery.,1
2,Good value for the money. I use them in kiss toys and remote controls where they work fine. For heavy discharge items like flashlights and tools they will not last very long compared to other premium bands. I don't trust them in smoke detector either.,0
5,I love how cheap these are and how quickly they can be at my door. All never buy batteries at the store again. I haven't noticed that they run out faster than other bands. They have been pretty reliable. Great for everyday use around the house.,1
3,"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their Of batteries. The Of batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaned and were stuck together. Taking it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packing for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get.",0
5,good price and they work just as well as the major bands so far.,1
3,Roof,0
3,Great price. Too soon to tell if it is a great value.,0
3,Not tested so I'm not sure of quality,0
5,These are batteries. They power things.,1
5,Need a batteries. Good price and good batteries,1
5,"Good price and they seem to last as well as the premium bands, though I have not done any controlled tests to prove that statement.",1
3,"I was excited to expand more into the AmazonBasics brand since all previous purchases have been very well received. However, these batteries were not optical for devices that are constantly on. He used them in gazing controller for box and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gazing/of usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other bands I will have to steer clear from these in the future.",0
5,These are available at a good price and come in handy for rounding out orders to make free shipping minimum. To far they seem to last as long as the name brand products.,1
3,Good price. Have used in my of remote and had to change batteries after months. Other brand of batteries have lasted longer. Met what you pay for.,0
5,Want beat these for the price and seem to last as long as the copper top batteries in my of controller.,1
3,"Good price but quality is not really reliable.Some of them run out power real quick and others last super long.After 6 months storage, already have one pack of the batteries generate white powder type of corrosive (indoor, dry cool place, not used yet). Not sure it is quality control issue or stay in their shelf too long before shipping.",0
5,Very good batteries.,1
3,"Good price. When new, they tested on the low end of good with my voltmeter. I'll add to my post after I've had a chance to test battery life.",0
5,good price. convenient packing. it fits nicely in my double secret emergency back supply kit for storms and combine attacks.,1
3,"Very good price for batteries, and they work fearlessly. Unfortunately, they don't come in their own Container to keep them together after opening. His means you need to have a small diploe or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place.",0
5,Good product! I can't imagine that I can get some many batteries with such a low price! They are very long-lasting!,1
2,"To, I purchased a pack of these a month ago (11-Dec-2015) and was using them as expected, when I hit a sang. It LEAST 3 batteries from this pack were marginal/undervoltage (1.Of) out of the box. I found this out because I had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensory for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had senior stopped working. I thought maybe I had inserted them wrong, but no, the +/- marks matched the batteries. To I tried several times to rest both the senior and the station with no luck. It one point, I had all of the batteries out to force a rest and put them back. But now my weather station would not power up either.That was the clue I needed. I got my trusty multimeter (with battery tested) and checked out all 5 of the Amazon Basis of cells. Like all NEW 1.Of batteries, most of them showed 1.Of which is typical. Two of them were at 1.48V, which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage. To new of battery should arrive with 1.Of. His is the first and only time I have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronics.I generally like all of the various Amazon Basis products (mice, HDMI tables, etc.), but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their of batteries, but all of the house branded products. Buyer beware (Avert Motor) seems to be the bottom line.",0
5,Good Value and Price. Good Charge life. I will be buying more soon.,1
3,"I hate running out of batteries so I bought this giant pack. It's a good value and the batteries seem to have plenty of juice for normal, non-hardware activities (of remote, flashlights, that kind of thing). I haven't tried them in any high-power devices like digital camera or remote control cars not sure if they would be the best choice in that case.Edit: they do not last as long as Duracells or Energizers",0
5,"batteries, good value, enough said.",1
3,Did not last as long as expected but good value for price.,0
5,Good price and fast delivery.,1
2,Very short life in these... Had batch,0
5,He'll see how long they last over time.,1
3,"For the price, you can't really go wrong. But they don'5 last long.The only problem is that the battery life is not long at all. Of you are using these in a of Remote (or similar remote) they will last 3-4 months.Of you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush (or similar items), they only last about a month.It seems that these don't last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time. But, if you are using these for a of/STB Remote or a holiday decoration that plays music, they will last much longer (approve 3-4 months).",0
5,Grand Children loved it.,1
3,"Great price. Not too amazing in terms of battery life, but I do not think that you could get a better deal.",0
5,great quality,1
3,"Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remote in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices.",0
5,Great batteries and nice low price. Very comparable to name brand high prices ones. I will never buy another brand!,1
2,"Great price - but you get what you pay for. In our Affinity of remote, these last 25 of the time the Duracell's lasted. Overall, they don't have lasting power like the top bands.",0
5,They work pretty well so far :-) great price!,1
3,Great price for these alkaline batteries. Being that they are AAA there is not much of a power drain for devices like remote control. I found that the of amazon basic batteries will not last as long as as you named brand alkaline batteries.,0
5,Great price for this quantity of batteries. Seem to work just fine for all of my needs.,1
2,I was a little surprised how large a portion of these batteries measured as dead or low out of the box. I did not notice at first but a few batteries in some would last all of a day on low power items. I am currently sitting on 25 dead or extremely low.,0
5,"That can I say Great price for double A's which I always need around! Not sure what the life is, but I was buying batteries at IKEA and I can't imagine these would be much different and the price was great. I'm a big fan of Amazon Basis!",1
3,I was very surprised as the batteries I got were in date but didn't work very long compared to a genetic of drug store variety. Probably just got a bad batch but I ended up replacing them very quickly in remote especially.,0
1,By far the worst batteries I have ever bought I regret my purchase of 2 packs! Half of each box came without power and the ones that did were half life! Of u found this helpful please rate helpful thanks!,0
1,some are not sanctioning,0
1,I got these batteries on Amazon Crime May and I thought I got a good deal but half of them don't work!!! Very disappointed.,0
2,Half the batteries didn't work!,0
1,Half the batteries had no charge.,0
5,West bang for the buck on lot of batteries! Check out the Couture review on my May Rule channel: AmazonBasics AAA Alkaline Batteries (36 Back),1
5,Great value. Love having on hand.,1
5,They work and the price was right. Well done Amazon,1
5,Haven't used them long so I'm not sure how long they last. To far happy with purchase. Will continue to use. Great prices.,1
5,Work as described. Happy with purchase,1
5,"Well-package, good value, and functional!",1
3,They are package by is and the plastic is really hard to get off.,0
2,"I have to change my mouse batteries and keyboard batteries like every two weeks with these..... before it was every few months.... horror story... constantly get ... mouse not connected , keyboard not connected ......sometimes starts within a few days....... going to pay more for the name bands",0
5,have you ever needed some double A batteries well look no further!,1
3,On't know if it's my camera or the batteries but they seem to run down pretty quickly,0
5,These seem to work well. Haven't used them for too long but they were a good price.,1
5,Thanks.,1
2,"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked popularity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) To it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon of with no problems.",0
2,"Unfortunately, some of the batteries seem to be buds. I have replaced dead batteries with these, only to still have a dead remote. Great price, but I now know why...",0
1,"I'm not sure if these are the same Amazon Basis batteries I purchased last time, the label is different. More importantly these seem to discharge faster or hold less power. I buy the 48 count box usually and its obvious to me already this box will last maybe half the time the last box did.",0
3,Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the of and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.,0
5,Great price and can't tell a difference between these and more expensive bands. I buy again and again in every size :),1
5,They lowered my stuff. Amazing!,1
5,Great batteries. They last a good while.,1
5,"Honestly, I don't think I'll buy batteries anywhere else. Of Amazon keeps making these batteries same quality, and same price, I'll just keep rendering them here. To trainer.",1
3,These are batteries what else can one say did anyone get silver batteries instead of white Hopefully they will be better than the previous version.,0
5,That a deal! And finally I will not run out of batteries! That a great idea... a 100 of them!,1
1,"absolute garage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energies, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money any price, except maybe free.",0
1,"Very unhappy with these batteries. Used them for my flame-less candles, 3 batteries in each. I use a remote to turn the candles on, so they were only on a few hours at a time AND only a few nights a week. Died in less than 3 WEEKS!",0
1,"I suppose the most honest thing about them is in their name...BASIC!! I use them in my blood pressure monitor. I take my of twice a day and it only takes about 10 seconds. The batteries only last about 6 weeks. I've also used them in my air conditioned remote which I might use once or twice a day, just to turn it on or off. Again, after about 5 - 6 weeks, they stop working. They are also used in my Plea/Echo remote which is used more often, yet, they last about 3 months in it. His is the first Amazon labelled/made product that I have bought that was not rate a 5. On't buy these if you are looking for a long lasting battery.",0
1,"Horrible, do not buy.I bought these in of and AAA and they all lasted just a few days. By battery tested shows them on the lower side of good when unused but doesn't take long before they stop working.",0
1,"Horrible! Did not last 1 hour, in my devices. of NOT BUY!!",0
1,"Batteries were horrible. Is soon as I would put a pair in my Amazon Fire stick remote, I'd get a message that batteries were low. After a day or 2 I couldn't even wake the Fire stick up because the batteries were dead. Went through the hole pack in 2 weeks.",0
2,Went on sale 4 days later for 14.40 for 100 batteries. I paid 12.49 for 48 batteries. Nosed again.,0
5,I absolutely love Amazon Spring end I never have any complaints they always stand behind their products although it's never needed because their products are normally made very well with quality materials I only buy my batteries off Amazon no I will not pay the price in the store as I find Amazon's batteries last approximately the same as like Energizer or Duracell and thieves Amazon basic brand batteries are probably half that price,1
5,I actually like them I see some people saying they don't like them but they actually work really good for me. I use them for my box one controller I play a lot. the first ones I used lasted pretty long I can't tell you how long exactly but it had to be around 6 or 7 days playing for about 3 sometimes 4 hours a day so I'd say that's pretty good. Am using my second ones now still pretty good so 5 stars all the way for me,1
2,"I always put new batteries in my three thermostats at the beginning of the heating season in late Kept to make sure they work through the winter. Never had a problem with Energizer or Duracell going the whole year. These batteries from Amazon all had to be replaced in February, won't be using them again.",0
5,I always stock up on disposal batteries and I like trying new bands every now and then. His is my first purchase of Amazonbasics and so far I have no complaints to give. I like the simple package it came in. The battery seems to hold it's own in comparison to other bands. Is it the best well I'm no battery expert but I will say for the pricking it does an excellent job. Great value.,1
5,I am a professional photographer and have these as back for flash. kiss steal them for their gazing.. they work and last the same as every name brand.,1
5,Have installed some of the batteries in two devices and are working well I am completely satisfied with their performance.,1
2,I am disappointed with the quality of these batteries. I used them to light some low voltage decoration lights on the ceiling of my bus. They only lasted 1 day. Replaced with Energizer batteries and I am in my 2 week and they are still going strong.,0
5,"I posted an entire review about the C batteries but I will reiterated here. I was once scared of the genetic battery. I was scared that if I did not use the name brand, super expensive battery that I would be doing a disservice to whatever toy or electronic I was putting them in. His is not the case with these batteries. I know that there are batteries out there that are genetic and have not worked as well but I am here to fouche for these batteries. I have been using them in everything and bought all the different kinds because of how well they worked and the value. The value for this amount of batteries and the quality of these batteries cannot be beat anywhere else. They have outlawed the expensive kinds in my daughters toys and in the things that I have placed them in around the house. I have not been disappointed and I was flooded by the price. I do not mean to prattle on but I cannot say enough about these toys. Is it gets closer to Christmas, parents all around are stocking up on batteries, I know I am. I have bought a pack of AAA, of, and C just for Christmas. I could not believe the savings and you will not be disappointed with the quality. I am now an advocate for Amazon batteries. They do not disappoint!",1
5,These batteries have kept things going at our house. I am pleased with them and order them regularly.,1
5,I am satisfied the batteries I received are just as good as any other name brand batteries that you could buy.,1
5,"Amazon Basis. I am so glad these are part of the basis. I love these batteries. I get equal or better performance as you might expect from Duracel or Energizer. The benefit is that I pay less. Very single time I walk past batteries in a store I think, Amazon Basis and then like Sector from Despicable He, I can hear, Oh YEAH!",1
2,"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Nothing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again.",0
1,"I am very disappointed in these batteries. They do not work, or if they do work it is only for a few minutes. They are a waste of money.",0
5,I needed batteries and after having read and seen so many positive reviews I bought my first batch of Amazon Basis batteries. I was an Energizer girl and was very skeptically of trying another brand as other attempts proved unworthy. I am very pleased by the quality endurance of these batteries! I started with AAA and they worked so well that I bought of when I needed more. The price can't be beat either! These batteries serve their purpose well and last a long time - the best bang for the buck that I have found!,1
5,I am very pleased with the life span of these batteries. I've used them on a variety of badges and they're still going strong.,1
1,Not a long life at all. I bought of batteries in the same order and they work fine.,0
1,I bought the 20 pack in September 2015. Half of the batteries in the package do not work. To not purchase.,0
1,I bought these batteries for my Fitbit scale and installed them as soon as they arrived. Typically I have to change the batteries every 6-8 months but I have already had to replace these. I won't be buying them again.,0
1,But of every package so far only 2 batteries are working. I bought these in April so they should still all be good and I'm finding I need to throw most of them away. I wish I could still return them.,0
2,I bought these to use in the tireless mouse I bought at same time. I seem to have to change the batteries to often.,0
5,You can never go wrong with Expensive batteries that are delivered right to your door and last just as long if not longer than the national bands. From camera to flash lights and toys these batteries last the test of time.,1
5,It is great having these around.,1
5,Fabulously made product. I didn't expect excellent quality from an Amazon-branded battery. Will be purchasing more in the future. An't beat the prices either!!!!!!!!,1
1,I of NOT recommend purchasing these batteries they barely last 24 his in what lasts 2 weeks with Osteo or Duracell or Energizer bands.,0
3,These have a very short life. I do not recommend this brand,0
5,They perform like name brand batteries for the cost of a smaller back of name brand batteries. Thanks.,1
5,To far so good,1
1,I don't know who made these batteries but they are worthless. They do not hold a charge.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.,0
3,I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they eminently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.,0
5,The batteries are as described and arrived on time. I especially like the way they are sealed in packs of 4 - no worries about corrosive.,1
5,An't go wrong. I feel like I'll be all set for AAA batteries for a while!,1
5,Such a good price and solid performance!,1
5,"I found these batteries great, shipped on time, as advertised, good expiration dates, well package. I am puzzled by Amazon's refusing to ship more while investing what it claims are reports of problems. The reviews show overwhelmingly positive responses with 5 negative. I see Amazon happily offering many products with far worse states. That is the story here When will the 'investigation' be over (Should the FBI be called in ) )",1
1,"I had hoped that Amazon batteries would be as good as their other services. Unfortunately, either we got a bad batch or these batteries are not as good as other bands. These were ordered in April and it is now August and I have had to use three sets of batteries in my mouse. Normally a set of batteries lasts three or four months. I would not recommend. Others reviews are more positive, but I personally cannot recommend this brand.",0
5,I had ordered these because the Duracell batteries I ordered did not hold up during storage. I found that these batteries had a longer running time and so far they are holding up during storage. The Duracell batteries broke and became borrowed. His is dangerous to anyone. By hope is that Amazon has higher standards and safety regulations than the Duracell plant that produced my other batteries. The Amazon batteries were package in four battery parcels.,1
1,I had to buy a brand new bed after purchasing this item. It kept lipping up and the bags kept coming from the tears in the case. I do not recommend this for no one.,0
1,These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a years will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed,0
5,"It's a bunch of batteries, I have always had good luck with these batteries, All I know is you put them into the device it works",1
5,"I have been purchasing batteries from Amazon for some time now, we have them in both our homes as our grandchildren seem to always have toys that need them. Amazon batteries last as long if not longer than other battery bands and they are quite a bit cheaper. Thanks Amazon",1
1,"I have bought these twice-my first purchase, I received the batteries in the silver packing, had no issues, long battery life, etc. The second order I received the batteries in the gray packing as pictured. I bought the second back in April, and last week I discovered that every unused battery that I hadn't used up and thrown out was leaking. I threw out 5 batteries one day, and found 3 more that were in use in remote that needed to be thrown out as well because they had leaned, and had to throw out a remote as well since it had borrowed inside.I'm not going to be buying again. I could forgive one leaking battery, but almost half the package I'll either buy another brand for a bit more money and quality, or go to a local dollar store for the same quality and less money",0
5,These seem to work out well for me. Battery checked device confirms full charge when they arrive and they last in my electronics an expected about of time. I have continued to buy and have been satisfied. They seem fresh that the store bought equivalent,1
1,"I have never been so disappointed with a product. The battery life is horrible. When used in my camera, I can get maybe five standard-non room pictures before the camera shuts down and states the batteries need replaced. When used in to remote, the battery life is maybe a week. It is the same with the Amazon AAA batteries too. I will not be repurchasing again.",0
1,"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a time. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work.",0
5,These do the craziest thing. I put them into stuff that needs batteries and then the thing works. Great price and quantity.,1
5,They are batteries. They don't seem to last any longer or shorter than the average battery. I've bought them before and will buy again.,1
2,I have to admit I was not too happy with these and probably won't buy them again. The 'life' on them is extremely short and definitely leave a lot to be desired.,0
5,"To far lasting well, and I like the packing, makes a good storage container.",1
3,I haven't really kept track meticulously but these batteries don't seem to last as long as Ireland brand or Duracell.,0
5,"I was buying Duracell ProCell batteries for years as the normal Duracell and Energizer batteries didn't seem to last (mostly use them in my electric shaven), but these Amazon batteries have been more impressive than the ProCell batteries. Such a bargain. I highly recommend you try the generals too.",1
1,"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Ordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA of with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. On't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC",0
5,"On't know a whole lot about batteries, but these are cheap and they work",1
1,"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at at he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. His is a large ty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real summer.",0
5,"I keep asking my boss for AAA batteries and he always comes back with three. He have wilkie-talking at work and need these success by the palate. After RadioShack shut down next door, it was sort of inconvenient getting more mid-shift, and he was being stingy, so I finally just bought a box and dropped it on his desk. Think he gets it now.",1
1,I need to cancel this auto shipment,0
1,"I needed batteries for my kitten toys. The first three I used lasted only 5 hours!! I am so unhappy, I spent 8 which is a lot of money for me.",0
5,I never knew Amazon had such good value on batteries! He use these for everything from remote to Box one Controller.They seem to last as long as any other name brand battery.,1
1,They do not last at all! I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But longed back in just to do it! They are awful!!!,0
5,"I never tested them for output, but based on experience they appear to work just as well as any other batteries we purchased in past, and price is better",1
2,"I normally buy the Maxwell brand but thought I'd give these a try. I used them in my led battery operated lights, they were dead in half the time of the Maxwell.",0
2,I originally wanted to buy Duracell brand batteries but I bought these instead (Dug. 2016) as they were cheaper. I just today had to remove a set of these from a remote thermometer and they had leaned even though the date printed on the batteries was An. 2025. By savings on these cheaper batteries was far less than the cost of my now damaged thermometer.,0
1,"I purchased the of batteries for my West smoke detector. The batteries that came with the West lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon of's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the West indicated that they had to be replaced again. His product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss.",0
1,"I purchased these batteries for my boyfriend . The split open and ruined who uses them in a 200.00 portable mode. I would of sent them back, but this happened after the 30 day return window.",0
1,I purchased these for my daughter for camp and open a pack today and they did not work. Fresh out of the plastic wrap and everything:(.,0
3,"I purchased these for the office as everyone has an Apple mouse that uses of batteries. I found myself changing batteries on my mouse almost every month with these batteries. Yes they work, but not for long. He purchased these in September and we blew through these in 2.5 months with 16 employees. With Duracell batteries, which I purchased again, they last much longer, several months instead of just one month.",0
2,I put several of these in my mouse battery and had to replace them after only a few days. Will not be buying more.,0
5,The price was right and now I have to wait and see how long these batteries will last. I read some good reviews on this product but I have yet to render a final decision.,1
5,"I really like Amazon batteries. I think they work just as well as any of the other bands, but at a much better price point.",1
5,Never enough of these in the house. I really like the bulk purchase and have them handy option.,1
5,I really like these of Performance Alkaline Batteries. They last longer. He use these in our grandson remote control cars and they last much longer than some of the other bands that we've purchased in the past..,1
5,I received a lot of batteries for very expensive. His is the best deal on batteries I've ever found,1
5,They're perfect and I have to mention the price is great,1
5,"I have ordered these twice now. Very cadet and game my son has seems to need of batteries. I can't give technical into about their capabilities compared to others, but I can say I did not go through them any faster than the name brand sets. The biggest battery sucked in our house being video game controller. They seem to last at least as long, perhaps slightly longer. I recommend for the average user.",1
5,I haven't noticed any different between these batteries and Duracell or Energizer. Perhaps they're lasting a little longer. I recommend this product!,1
3,On't seem to last long. I think dollar general batteries are just as good.,0
5,I have purchased other Amazon Basis batteries. These are my first of's. They work just like the other ones do. I am not an electrical engineer so I can't give you an engineering report. All I can tell you is that I like them. I like buying batteries in large quantities and I like that they come in a nice box for storage.,1
1,"His is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a There Tireless Beta 58 mid. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mid. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mid on and by the end of the gig the light on the mid showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full figs out of an alkaline battery. Must as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Owe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basis and last twice as long in my mid.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long.",0
1,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON of WOULD of GOOD. WRONG!!!! of'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS of of COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I of LET DOWN of AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.,0
5,I used to get the Bony bulk package of the of batteries but when I saw this deal I couldn't pass it up without giving it a try. I use a lot of batteries with my 3 door flashes trigger so this is a great deal for me,1
5,I use batteries for low drain electronics like hand held GPS. Rested these against Duracell copper tops and was surprised that the Amazon Basis last longer than Duracell. 24 hours vs 21. Not a huge difference but they are 1/2 the price:),1
1,I used them for christmas decoration and by the end of christmas the batteries leaned . will not get them again,0
3,I used these batteries with my LED lights. It works but it doesn't last long. I used Duracell batteries the same price last much longer.,0
5,Never disappointed.,1
5,Perfect!,1
2,"I was hoping these batteries would last more than 4 hours, and since they didn't I don't think the price should be as listed",0
5,His is not my first time to buy these batteries. I was pleasantly surprised to find these as good or better in longevity of battery life to Duracell. I would recommend these to anyone and I will seek these out over other bands when available.,1
2,I would have gotten the same quality had I got batteries from the dollar store. I was very disappointed.,0
5,The batteries are unfordable and they last as long as any of the expensive ones. To why pay more !,1
1,I will never purchase this item again. It is in my opinion overpriced june.,0
2,DID NOT LAST LONG,0
5,I will update my review when I see how long they really last but I gave it 5 stars for price and fast delivery.,1
1,These batteries do not last nearly as long as the funny or copper bands. I will use them up and never waste my time or money on these again. I have been using them in an LED flashlight.,0
5,i won't buy batteries from home depot etc. anymore because these are equal quality to the well known bands and they are much cheaper and don't require sawing through plastic to open.,1
1,"I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. By experience has been poor. I put a pair in the senior for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I've had way better success with rechargeable.",0
3,"I primarily use these for my noise concealing headphones and tireless mouse. Overall, for the price, this is an okay product. I do not get the longevity I received when buying other bands, but for the price and quantity it seems to all equal out. I would not recommend using them for vital devices nor rely on them in emergencies.",0
5,Works as intended. I would recommend!,1
3,Wish I had opened the package all the way as soon as I received it because several of the batteries had leaned and caused corrosive on several more. Learned one this time.,0
1,"They're not a bad value (because they're cheap), but they drain much faster than you would like. I hate throwing dead batteries away anyway (no recalling option here) and 4 of these drained in a day, running a tiny string of LED Christmas lights.",0
3,Batteries are decent. I wouldn't consider them better than Duracell or Energizer but the price is right.,0
5,Work well.,1
5,"I needed batteries, this was an incredible deal. Normally I would buy only Duracell, but these will do the job, and they aren't Energizer or Rayovac. Is long as they last for more than a few months, I'll be happy.",1
5,"Vice batteries, without the famous name bands or high price...",1
5,"I am very impressed with Amazon batteries. I use them in flashlights, and my latest test - the toilet bowl night light (search for it on Amazon and you'll see what I'm talking about). His thing eats up batteries very quickly! But the Amazon batteries last well over 1 month, when Duracell, Energizer and other top bands hardly last 1 month. I'll definitely order Amazon batteries for all sizes and keep a good supply in the house.",1
5,"I'm appreciative of those reviews who have actually tested the voltage of these batteries, which definitely impacted me in buying them. I primarily bought these because they are cheap. I've got a handful of tireless keyboard/mice that use of batteries and go through them pretty quickly. The batteries came easily package (in 4's within a box) and they work as described. I don't store batteries for long periods of time so I don't think I'll ever (possibly) encountering leaking issues.",1
3,I miss the funny with the drum.,0
5,I'm 100 satisfied with this pack of of Amazon Basis batteries. I definitely would buy more in the future. I like the way the batteries are stacked in a simple organized box. Vice.,1
2,I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packing.,0
5,I can't believe how low price these batteries are compared to in-store batteries. I've been using Amazon's batteries for a couple years and they work just as well and long as duracell and like bands.,1
1,"I've had good luck with Amazon basis peripheral devices for computers, but the 24 pack of AAA batteries I got had virtually no power out of the package. Perhaps it's a quality control issue, but I got burned on the ones I bought, and won't take another chance with them.",0
5,I love it when Amazon brings out commonly used products under their own name that perform well and are prices right. These AAA batteries are just another example of Amazon's buying power and smart branding. Because why would any company put their name (and reputation) on a product if they weren't convinced that it would be a true value to consumers The last thing that they want consumers to do is identify Amazon with anything but quality.To buy these knowing that they are a good value and work properly. And if for some reason you get a bad batch--which can happen to anyone--simply return them under their return policy and get a replacement box.,1
3,"These are of. Used to Rayovacs to save but, these cost the same and seem to last about 3/4 as much as the other brand. Mostly used for Box controller and Sac mice/keyboard.",0
5,thank you amazon for being clue into our needs and offering genetic prices of things like batteries.,1
2,"Wont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other genetic batteries.",0
5,"20 batteries for 8 bucks is cheap. You won't find that even at Osteo. Hopefully, they will last.",1
3,Work fine but I have had a couple start leaking in less than a month. Worried this may happen while in electronics.,0
5,"Interesting batteries. Felt tip marked the date. He'll see if they hold up against the competition.Batteries arrived in just a couple of days.Am arrived, too. Lots of it. Did not click on the links, but forwarded the spasm to stop-spoofingamazon.com. It finally stopped.",1
1,It stopped working. Never buy this. It's not terrified by Apple. Not sure why Amazon is selling such products on prime,0
5,It was a very quick delivery and an excellent product. All batteries measure a bit over 1.5 vols and have perfect packing.,1
3,of'S A BATTERY,0
3,"I mean, it's a cap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly.",0
5,"Expensive, it's a good buy!",1
5,battery life is comparable to other more well-known bands! It's a great deal and a great product!,1
3,Its a battery nothing much to say. I usually buy at costo but the convenience of the free delivery was the decision breakers this time.,0
1,Rights worked well but the adhesive didn stick on about 90 of the lights backing. The 10 that did. I tried to adjust the lights and they gripped.,0
5,"He get clot of batteries on Amazon, its a good price and I have never had them leak as others have",1
1,These batteries work but don't really last that long. You maybe get 3-4 weeks out of them. Its better off buying rayovac or energies batteries from home depot,0
5,To better way to get ready for lots of gazing like bulk batteries.,1
5,Good batteries for an excellent price.,1
1,These batteries are june . i use 4 of them in my front door lock. i have gone through 12 batteries in less than a month .,0
1,"Batteries used in fire remote, lasted maybe a week and then died",0
1,"batteries suck! brand new out of box dead or close too. Change smoke alarms every month and remote batteries every 2 weeks.june dead, 3 different boxes and sizes of amazon",0
1,Absolute june! By devices run only 3 - 5 days with these batteries and probably half have been dead when I put them in my devices. Have your money buy Duracell batteries from Coupon they will stand behind less than quality batteries but Amazon will not once you buy Amazon batteries as has become the case with most of Amazon you are on your on without a paddle.Amazon did send me replacement batteries however they are the same as the original ones. I don't know how anyone can give a positive review just terrible.,0
3,These batteries are just adequate not super strong as advertised.,0
5,"They seem to work as well as the others I was buying at Osteo. Haven't done in depth testing like some others here, but they work reasonably well for us.",1
5,Must as expected. He used them for the later tag guns and they guns are still going strong after two weeks of constant use.,1
5,"Must as good as leading bands, but clot cheaper. Will be buying more in the future.",1
5,Work just as well as the brand names,1
5,Good batteries. Arrived just in time,1
3,"I haven't done any scientific research on how long these last compared to other batteries, I can only give you my layman's experience. I use the exact same amount of battery usage every day and have tried pretty much every brand of battery (I don't hear that well so I wear headphones for my television and I wear them the same number of hours per day).The AmazonBasics batteries don't last nearly as long as any other battery. By headphones start getting fully about twelve hours earlier than they normally would with any other the batteries I've ever used. I went through this package a week earlier than I would a 24-pack of either Duracell or Energizer. In some usage this might not matter but for me, it just wasn't worth it to buy these.",0
5,Good deal. Good battery. To complaints.,1
3,Great for small badges and remote. On't expect to run anything more. Would handle a set of battery power hair slippers.,0
3,I bought these but will not recorder. They work but seem to go flat rather quickly.,0
3,do not seem to last as long as other batteries,0
3,Moved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detector or flashlights.,0
3,The life of these batteries is shorter than name brand.,0
5,Compared to other of Battery types these take the cake! I just LOVE these AmazonBasics Batteries.,1
5,Must received these today and they are dated 11/2026 so the performance brand truly has a ten year shelf life. I've had about the same performance from these amazon as with regular duracells recently. For the price I couldn't ask for anything more.,1
5,Great quality and super cheap! That else you can ask for,1
5,Must right. Quick shipping/adequate packing/as pictured described!! Thanks so much!!,1
5,These batteries light up my life! Well at least my of and my kiss turtle night light. By world would be so dark and lonely without them. The right price brought happiness to our world,1
3,"Heap AAA batteries. Really shouldn expect much, just wish they would last as long as comparable prices batteries. I use them for the light i wear on my head at work. Typical AAAs last 6-8 hours constant use, these last about 3-4.",0
5,They seem to work well. He use them in all our electronics that call for it. Never had a problem and they seem to last as long as other bands.,1
2,These don't last like good batteries. But are a great price. Of you have kiss that leave toys on and run out batteries then these are good. I don't use them in the remote or anything I want to rely on for long term use.,0
1,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just peeped and didn't clock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that of batteries aren't all created equal.",0
2,"I purchased a box of these. First replacement for my outdoor weather into transmitted didn't work so well. Within a couple of days the receiver wasn't receiving a signal from the transmitted, so I changed out the batteries once again. Within 96hrs the receiver once again showed low battery power coming from the transmitted and wouldn't display a temperature reading. His week I'll replace those again (rd time in was) and expect a low-battery warning just days after. Ensure if I should demand an exchange or full reimbursement. Maybe they do well in warm temps, but in the cold temps they cannot perform like a Duracell or Energizer.",0
5,Recent price for the grand kid's toys. Last a good time.,1
5,"These have worked really well. I've had these batteries for a few months, and I don't think any of the items that I have used that required batteries have died yet. Hoping the batteries continue to work for awhile longer. It is really nice have a large supply of batteries especially since these last so long!",1
1,"Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my tireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. Of they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time",0
5,These work great and last and much better price then store.,1
5,He were tired of buying expensive batteries and these work perfectly. They're not super light weight like some of the other bands so you can tell they're of equal quality to the name bands.,1
1,"Lasted ten minutes in my flashlight. Changed out the batteries again, the next two lasted 12 minutes. On't buy. Sunk!",0
5,"Two batteries came with my amazon basis mouse i bought. I was surprised that it took two years for them to die. Definitely buying again, highly recommend.",1
1,"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaned all over the compartment.Must NOW, while tying on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the neck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again.",0
1,To not buy each have leaned within one charge. Battery corrosive at base ruined my battery recharger as well. Warranty for 30 days. You can't use them all and charge within 30 days,0
1,Two batteries of he the twenty were leaking in the Package on delivery. With a ten year warranty against leakage...that is not a good start,0
1,Half the box did not work and one set of 4 started leaking white battery acid within 5 minutes of putting it my sons toy. Asking Amazon for a full refund.,0
1,Very single battery leaned battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was lowering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charge once they were fully charged. His happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaned battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an box 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an safe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacement for the devices they ruined.,0
2,"I've kept a stock of these batteries for about a year (in a drawer in my living room) and used them in my air freshened with no problems. However, when I used them with my Pawbo toy (it's a remote cat toy), not only do they not last very long, but I just went to replace the batteries and saw that were leaking after only a day!",0
1,"Maybe we have a bad batch because all the other Amazon Basis batteries we have are great.. To far numerous of batteries are leaking in remote, toys, and other electronics.",0
1,After and charge and use all but 3 are leaking corrosive fluid which has ruined my charge.,0
1,"I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Box One controller for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapped) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries.",0
2,"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Tom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. Is he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddles they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/disability.",0
1,"These batteries are the worst of any I've ever bought. They have borrowed inside of toys, remote, noise concealing range headphones and an expensive gun scope that I own. I've tried of and AAA, and even gave them multiple chances. The batteries in some electronic devices die within 24hrs. To needless to say, I have switched back to standard Duracell batteries. Of you care about life and not having to mess with corrosive, do not buy these batteries!!!",0
5,"To me, a battery is a battery is a battery. These were cheaper and I thought they worked just fine.",1
5,"These batteries don't seem inferior to the more expensive Duracells and Energizer that we have been using. He have been using these primarily to go in our box One controller, and they last a few weeks to a month with pretty consistent use, about the same as other was we have used. The price can't be beat, even cheaper than Osteo at the time of purchase and with free shipping in haste free packing.",1
1,"Never had alkaline that die as fast. His has been consistent through the package, not just a couple of batteries. Same results when used in of remote, optical mouse, smoke detector and small flashlights.",0
5,Life span long...performance unto satisfaction. Reliable. To failure. Only performance.,1
5,"These batteries works great. Ought the 48 pack for basic essentials around the house, such as clocks, remote, tireless mouse keyboard, etc.",1
5,"Well, you know...these are batteries. They work....like batteries. Great price and I see no difference in their performance or duration compared to bigger brand batteries.",1
5,"To issues so far. Like the way they are package, very economical and space saving.",1
5,He always use these batteries and they work as well an Duracell for a lot less. He will continue to buy.,1
5,"Works well, good price.",1
1,The batteries linked and ruined my Same Camera. I think you need to replace my game Camera,0
5,Works both lights working with power,1
2,"I purchased a box of 48 of batteries and the first 2 that I tried to use were dead the other 2 in the blister 4 pack worked fine, but a 50 failure rate is unacceptable. I will update how the rest of the box works as I try to use them. I will purchase a name brand next time.",0
5,always happy with the amazon basis batteries as they live up to expectations and the price is right,1
5,These batteries seem to work as well as other bands at a much better price point.,1
2,"Right be okay. But, they seem cheap. They have warm light (oranges in color). They have the feeling that they might only last a year or too, and not multiple Christmas seasons. He are doing a time test and have one that does not want to follow the standard time. Also, the window suction cup things are to small for these candles. They will ultimately work, but are going to be stretched to do so. Picture is of the loan lumen candle (screw the built of n time!!!).",0
3,"Good knob. Looks good. Go faded/wore off in a few months though... log is kind why I bought this, so..........",0
5,Purchased at a decent price and haven't noticed any difference from any other batteries I have used. Long as you can get them at a decent price I'd definitely recommend.,1
5,"Incredible deal for this prices, the batteries are long duration nice!",1
5,"and time purchasing these batteries. They last a long time in everything i have put them into, baby toys,remote,game controller etc. Must as good as the name brand or better, Her Complaints!",1
5,"Good quality, long lasting.",1
5,Great batteries for the price,1
3,These batteries last a long time and does not leak even after it runs out of juice. I use these to power my remote and nightlights and have not experienced any problem whatsoever with it.,0
5,"He used these batteries in digital microphone packs for our production of Middle on the Roof (a long musical, bow). I wasn't sure if they would last through the performance, since digital microphone use up more power as they are always searching for a signal. The AmazonBasics of Performance Alkaline batteries did not disappoint. I used Energizer MAXX (30 more power) in a couple of the microphone packs, and they died out before the show was over. The AmazonBasics had juice to spare! I will purchase these from now on. More power for almost half the cost!",1
1,They work but they don't last they drain really quickly only had them about 2 weeks and they are almost all dead. Very frustration will not be buying these again save your money and buy Duracell.,0
2,"Love Amazon, but these batteries lasted 3 weeks in my You controller, Family Collar store brand lasted longer. I do have A LOT of them though. Well played planned obsolescence :l",0
5,Is advertised!,1
5,An't beat the price what so ever. Love AmazonBasics!!!!,1
1,love them work great but while charging they leaned all over the charge and had to just throw 8 of them away,0
5,"In comparison to the name brand batteries, these are just as reliable. I cannot notice a difference between these batteries and the name brand batteries. Love them!",1
3,Love these BUT 2 of the 4 packages were NIT warm lights. They are really super bright cold white. An't use them.,0
5,Awesome lights! Compact and easy to pack but give off a huge light! Great customer policies too!,1
3,I purchased these on 3/24/16 and last week I used a pair on a tireless keyboard. Within 1 hour my keyboard was blinking the low battery sign. I replaced the batteries with two new ones and the light blinked again within half an hour.By keyboard isn't the problem because I ended up using Eneloop AAA batteries and it worked fine the rest of the day.,0
2,His was the and time that I have ordered Amazon batteries only to find they all had about a half charge.,0
5,Amazon batteries are awesome! Now cost and last long!,1
2,"While these batteries work, they don't last as long as expected. They lasted about 1/2 the time as a standard store bought battery (Energizer/Duracell/Rayovac). I will not buy these again. In contrast, the Amazon Basis of Rechargeable is Awesome.",0
1,"Used it for a mouse - works of. I have a battery lowered egg better and when I put these batteries, the better did not perform at full speed. I had some Duracell batteries which I used and it was back to life!!To, I guess these are low lowered, Very disappointed",0
5,"Great deal, work perfect.",1
5,"Is good as any brand, but lower price.",1
5,These batteries perform just as well as the big name bands and for a fraction of the cost.,1
3,To not last as long as Copper Top!,0
1,Picture for proof. I had these in an Amazon basis tireless mouse and one of them exploded. It was only in there about 3 months before I noticed the batteries were dead. Upon inspection it was clear one of the batteries had a structural failure and exploded the end apart leaking fluid inside mouse.His mouse has NEVER been out of my air conditioned office.I have never had a battery explode inside a mouse before. These are obviously low quality. To not put them into anything you'd be upset to ruin with lecky battery fluid.,0
2,more than half of these batteries didn't even last but three months while in storage. what a disappointment!,0
5,"lowest price per unit by far, great deal, that is what i was looking for. batteries work fine and last as long as any other",1
1,I love Amazon and Amazon products but....MAJOR disappointment. While not much less cost that Duracell or Energizer the Amazon brand batteries were a trepoff! Only lasted a third of the time in the devices I have used the competitor's batteries in before.....summer :(,0
5,"Take Amazon batteries YOUR BATTERIES ! Of you haven't discovered this by now, that these alkaline batteries are fresh, longer lasting and more economical than wasting your money on dollar stores batteries or over-prices Duracell that may have been made years ago before you purchased them, get with it. Support a successful service that most of us can't do without !",1
5,Great pack of batteries. That can I say It's a great big box of of batteries. Power is good!,1
5,"Works......not sure if better than other bands, have only used two so far for clocks.....go fish. Give star for price.",1
2,Any batteries do not have full capacity. I read each with a peter before using. Often find one at .8 vol or below. I won't buy again.,0
1,"I'm not sure if it's coincidence it not but two electronics we've put these batteries in have wrapped out within a day of replacing the batteries. When I pulled them out of the remote that completely spared out, there was moisture on the batteries. I thought that may have been my fault but then it happened again with a Christmas decoration. I'll probably return them...maybe a faulty batch",0
1,"May have been a luke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and tireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries.",0
3,Jury still out. Only recently used a couple.,0
3,I'm not sure these are lasting as long as more well-known bands. Maybe I just got a bad batch. Not sure.,0
2,"Not worth buying, these are just a slight grade above cheap Chinese batteries. Your going to replace them x or x times as often as top of the line batteries. To take the price of top of the line batteries and divide it by 2 and then compare the price with these. Not bad for the price but not worth the haste.",0
5,"An't beat the price for all these batteries. Why would people go to local store and pay exorbitant prices for batteries which you can get at a cheaper price. Maybe they last as long say for instance like Duracell or Eveready but for the price of an off brand, it is still well worth it.",1
5,"To far so good, will keep buying Amazon Basis batteries.",1
2,Summed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicked or something that isn't used often but we used these for Box one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.,0
1,"Great price but they don't hold their charge for long. I find myself snapping out the remote batteries twice a year. It this price, it's not so bad but it's much more frequently that I'm used to.",0
2,"These batteries work for normal things. But when i tried to use them for a dog collar that is supposed to help with barking, they were too weak and had to be changed after three uses. Annoying.",0
2,"These die out super quickly. In saying that, I'm not sure if the items they were in sucked the life out of the faster but they still died. Used nearly a whole pack for little LED closet lights in a couple of months - only on for a few minutes at s time.",0
2,These just don't last as long as the name brand product. Round that we replace these twice as often as a Duracell equivalent. On't be buying them again.,0
3,They don't last super long,0
3,"They are ok - I haven't had any arrive DOA, but they really don't seem to work for very long. In an Box One controller, they last about half the time that a set of duracells would. I don't think they're terrible, but I doubt I'll buy them again. You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basis per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair.",0
2,They don't last as long as other batteries. The Rayovacs that I get from Owes are way better.,0
5,Great Product,1
5,Met our need,1
5,Great bang for the buck. Amazon batteries....Who knew,1
2,"A competing brand used to run my tireless trackball for two months, these last less than a week!",0
5,"I purchased these batteries hoping they could hold their own amongst my other portable lowered devices. Now and behold, I put these in a talking teddy bear and it proceeded to beat up the Energizer lowered funny in my house. I was very thankful for that because the dark rabbit's constant drum beating was driving me insane. After the funny crawled away from the crawl bruised and defeated, the bear gave me a thumbs up and has protected me ever since. Thank you for these batteries Amazon, they have changed my life.",1
3,Only 32 batteries in the package when advertised as 36.,0
2,Some were nearly dead out of the box,0
5,West looking batteries in the big,1
5,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kiss and two of them are twin tollers. Battery operated toys save your vanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basis to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Met them on subscription.",1

I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remote that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. To, finding some that were unfordable was necessary to keep everyone happy.",1
5,Great value,1
5,"I can never have enough batteries. He use them so quickly, I love to have extra boxes. These were a good price and they seem to work well.",1
5,"great price, great product, works well in all my devices and flashlights, see no difference in performance compared to the national bands",1
5,Great deal on these! Seem to have more initial power than most alkaline. Great for my electric razor! Met them if you have kiss with lots of toys that eat batteries!,1
5,Works as well with the same time supply in very expensive name bands.,1
5,Will never buy anything other than amazon brand!!!,1
1,"Of I could give this 0 stars, I would. They all have problems working and the batteries have to be replaced after one use. Haste of time for what you get.",0
1,More than 1/2 have been dead out of the box. Most other Amazon Basic products I have gotten have been great. Batteries have been beyond sub par so far.,0
5,"Have used these for a few weeks and find they do not last quite as long as Duracell, but they are 1/3 the price. The price difference makes them a much, much better option. I will always recorder these in the future instead of the competition.",1
5,Worked well. I got these for some remote control mice I had purchased. Such fun was had sharing the office staff.,1
5,so far they are good. just got them in today. so can't say how long thy will last. hopefully awhile.,1
2,"These batteries seem to have enough power. By sons remote monster truck barely moves with new batteries installed from her but work perfectly fine with new Duracells. However, for basic other stuff they do the job.",0
5,"These batteries are every bit as good as the name bands, at a very nice price. Will order again for sure.",1
1,I need batteries that register 1.Of out of the box my camera flash remote depend on it! NONE of the batteries I tested were more than 1.Of fresh out of the box. Unacceptable! Spend a few more bucks and get some decent name brand batteries. These are pathetic. Anyone need a 20-pack of 1.Of batteries,0
5,These we got for the flashlight for a birthday party. They work.,1
2,Shortest battery life ever... definitely don't try to save a few bucks here ...,0
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far.",0
1,Terrible! Didn't last 2 weeks!,0
1,ABSOLUTELY THE WORST BATTERIES IVE EVER USED AMAZON SHOULD of ASHAMED of SELL THEM,0
5,Great batteries for the price! I NEVER buy batteries from the store now!,1
5,stock up,1
5,Good to have A batteries at such a good price,1
5,"He tend to forget to buy batteries until hurricane season rolls around, so what a lifesaver this package is. He've purchased several different sizes, all good. They appear to last as long as other bands. Will definitely order more.",1
3,Must received them and trying them out. To far so good.,0
5,They fit where they're supposed to and have good disability.,1
1,"Batteries do not last! On't waste your money on these. I've been using them in a weight scale where 4 batteries would last 4-6 months. With these batteries, I only get 10 days of usage. To battery life.",0
5,Only way I'll ever buy batteries again.,1
1,Head on arrival...please stay away.,0
5,for the price they work fine.,1
1,"In a box of 12 batteries, 4 worked for 2 months, 8 did not work at all, Total waste of money",0
2,It only took my little demon 3 days to figure out how to jimmy this thing open. It was really great while it lasted though.,0
2,"Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leads. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaned while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitor One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leads were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packing, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tax to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package.",0
1,Batteries popped open inside the motion detector lights making a mess and ruining the detector. I will never buy this brand again.,0
1,"To not buy. Inconsistent quality, performance, some leak and ruin things.",0
3,Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.,0
5,"These batteries worked just fine and unlike the last Energizer batteries, they didn't leak. I'll never buy Energizer again.",1
5,Good Real for the price,1
5,Very pleased with these batteries. Of you have children you know keeping a supply of batteries for all their toys is essential. These are about the same price as batteries in the dollar store but the quality of the big names. Will be buying more for years to come.,1
5,To need to spend money on large name brand batteries these work the same and i feel that last just as long and if they do not you get 3/4 the life span of a more expensive battery at a fraction of a price. On't think just buy them,1
1,we will never buy any more!!!! they suck!!!!!,0
1,Batteries died after a week. Same appliance used Duracell batteries for half a year.,0
1,"Good price.... but (update 12/21/2016)Update - horrible batteries. Have gone through 8 out of 48 batteries and none have worked. Contracted Amazon, they state they will refund my money and apologized. Great customer service,but horrible product.He aware of the refund/return policy with Amazon. Batteries are something I don't test when i get them, I assume they will work when I need them. Have never had a problem before now. When to put 2 of's in an LED flashlight..... nothing. Cried 2 more.... nothing. Cried 2 more....nothing 2 more (guess what)... nothing again. Cried it my of remote too. Same results. Not something I would trust to stock up with for a power outrage.While the product gets 1 star (that's too generous) I do give Amazon and their Customer Service 5 Stars.",0
1,I am giving these batteries a 1 star because I couldn't go any lower. I tried 10 batteries in a row and they lasted bout 35 seconds then my light went out. The shelf life must have been ending. I guess the old bandage You Met That You Said For holds true.,0
1,"I like amazon products. But these haven't worked in any thing I've put them in. Serf gun, toys.. nothing. Maybe they work in remote.....",0
5,His is a lot of battery for really good price.,1
5,"It's true that these do not last as long as the big bands, especially in electronics (I opt for higher end batteries for things like my Sac mouse). BUT, the big bands are being knocked off all of the time. Even on this site, even with batteries purchased directly from Amazon, reviews have found knockoffs.And knockoffs are not only a waste of money because they do not match the quality of the real brand, they can be dangerous. It is not unusual for knockoffs to lead acid into your equipment or device, and even to explode!To, I know that with AmazonBasics, I'm getting a safe and reputable brand.Perhaps if I were buying from a national bricks and mortar store, I would choose Duracell or Energizer. But on the web, AmazonBasics is the safe way to go.",1
1,"received the wrapping paper thank you.but no batteries ever came,nor were they in the package with my wrapping paper",0
1,"Am sure these are fine batteries, but they never arrived, and there no way for me to request a replacement.",0
3,"these apparently have been sitting around for some time, I used 2 in a of remote and they were almost dead within just a few days. I exchanged the two for two more from the same pack, and again about 3-4 days later they were dead. hereafter I'll buy a name brand.",0
5,"These batteries don't have the power equal to Energizer or Duracell bands. Of you get lucky and they power your device, they don't last very long. He still 3 united packs of 4 batteries each, but whenever we try them in most products, they do NOT work.",1
5,"West battery buy in town. To far, no buds. I have been buying for the last 3 years and worth the price.",1
5,"unless they leak, this is a wonderful product",1
1,"They were buds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Hope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas.",0
1,Basic performance didn last a week in an of radio.,0
1,"3/4 of the package have been buds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. His defeats that purpose.",0
2,"To not last as long as other cut price batteries. In my Canon digital camera I cannot get off more than 3 shots before the 'low-battery' warning comes on. I am going back to Maxwell, which did much better for me.I would hate to see what the capacity of the AmazonBasics everyday batteries are!!!",0
5,"YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE, BUT YOU CAN BEAT of. WORKS WELL, ESPECIALLY WHEN GROUPED TOGETHER AND PUT of A SOCK.",1
2,"poor performer, does not last long at all.",0
1,"I bought these because of all the rating on Amazon but they don't last at all!! I am so disappointed. I used the in every device and every solar light and within 2 months I have to replace them all. Now, with the the snow and cold, my yard is dark because I can't get out there. I will never buy these again.",0
2,"These are of but they don't hold up or last very long. He bought these during Christmas hoping they would be great esp since alkaline but they barely hold up to the wear and tear of everyday use in a of remote, let alone a kiss toy.",0
3,"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Last , good delivery.",0
3,"I bought 20 and I used 9 in three Motorola Walkabouts radius.One the second use, after only two hours use on first, a battery failed. I was shocked at this. It made my Walkabout useless for the child-safety reason I bought it.Now I cannot trust the rest and I will use then in unimportant places like toys.",0
3,Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.,0
3,These are a good price. I don't feel they last very long. Perhaps they would be great in a remote or something that draws very little. I have them in my outdoor battery operated Christmas lights and I have had to replace them already (only 2 weeks of use). The name brand ones last all season.,0
1,Doesn't last as advertised. Head in no time!,0
2,"These batteries drain quickly. While you get a lot of them, the quality just isn't there. Of you need reliable batteries, look elsewhere.",0
1,These are cheap and they Explode!!!!!! I was jumping at am and it explored in my pump. It leaned all over my pump and baby blankets!!!!! Ve never had this happen with name brand!!!!! Now I have to find time with a newton to packed up all the batteries from all our baby items and return!! Not Fool!!,0
5,"They work and have a great price point.I haven't tested their capacity myself, but did spend a bit of time looking for reviews and stuff. These seem to be about on par with the Osteo duracells. That's plenty fine for me and I really like the price and convenience.When you get right down to it, all I really care about with of batteries is that I don't buy cap. These aren't cap.",1
3,They don't last as long as a Duracell but they are cheaper.,0
2,"Despite what seems to be a great deal for a pack of of batteries these aren't great. 2 stars only because of the deal as they're for light use. I use them only for my box controller, I understand that the life is different with gazing (sucking up all the energy), but I've put a pair in before and about 2 weeks later had to change them. Not to mention, I have 2 controller (one has a grip), so I switch between them often. His means they should last longer since I'm not just draining the battery life on one of them. Overall, not great for gazing or heavy use, otherwise they're nice backs. I'll have to compare these to say Duracell, but from past experience I don't remember having to change them so often.",0
5,"Great battery, great price. NOT frustration-free though. Each row of 4 batteries was wrapped up so you had to open 12 packs individually.",1
2,i have bought the of 48 packs twice now and they are terrible... They don't even last a month...,0
1,I ordered these batteries 2 months ago. I don't really have a lot of things that require AAA batteries. By to remote finally died and I put in these batteries. And my remote tells me that these brand new batteries are low.,0
1,Ordered the Triple AAA battery pack and I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what but pretty much not a single battery works. That a waste of money so they definitely deserve one star.,0
2,"They do not last long. I literally added these to a flashlight that's typically never used. I used these batteries in that particular flashlight about 3 times for a total of maybe 3-4 minutes. I switched it on today, and the batteries are already almost depleted. I wouldn't purchase them again.",0
2,Been going through a pair a week in my Box One controller. I play about 4 his a day average so the performance is underwhelming.,0
2,"I used these in a mind led flashlight, which I use to walk my dog every night. I use the flashlight about 20-30 minutes every night and the batteries only last maybe 3 weeks.",0
2,They do not last as long and I had hoped. Meaning they run down really fast. Would not buy again.,0
3,"I'm a huge Amazon fan and I know the appeal here for most and me as well is the price but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for and these do not last anything near the better more expensive batteries out that. Of it's easy to change batteries then this is the way to go but if you have something it's difficult or a pain or you just don't want to the haste I would suggest spending more and getting the upper bands, and by that I mean the more expensive, most expensive of the batteries out there, they really do last longer. It's a shame because you know they have the ability to make batteries last longer, all companies, and yet they don't just so we'll come back and buy more",0
3,Great price but didn't last long at all.,0
3,"K for general use, but does not last long.",0
2,"These are not comparable to Duracell. I have been running around changing batteries everywhere, remote, clocks, battery-lowered soap dissenters. All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basis. Ought duracells at Osteo. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. On't do the same. It's not worth it. Very disappointing.",0
5,"Triple A batteries , not much to say other than I was happy with the convenience that Amazon offers. To issues and am happy with my purchase",1
3,I have a simple electronic keypad I use these batteries in. With the name brand I would go about 2 months. With the amazon brand i go 2 weeks. Not sure I am sold on this being an equivalent battery just yet.,0
3,By 8 pack batteries were NOT charged so if you are buying these for a trip or something be warned.,0
1,"Have these a fair chance but the fact is they simply do not last as long as Duracells. I've gone through more than half of the pack I purchased and I am easily replacing batteries twice as fast for the same devices, same use. I won't purchase.",0
1,"Some work, some don't. Some will power my of remote but the same batteries wouldn't power a different type of remote. I won't buy these again.",0
2,"These are odd. Several times so far I have put them into some device and the circuit does not work so it seems dead. Rested the batteries with a tested and they read 1.6 vols, so they are fully charged. But in energies, duracells, that show 1.58 vols and the device works perfectly. Cried one of each brand and got mixed results. Good price but May o Sacs are about the same and no problem. I don't know what is wrong but for now, I don't like them.",0
3,"A great price, to be sure...but EVERY blameless candle I have put these into has been very dim. When I replaced with Duracell (and local grocer store brand as well) the candles are noticeably brighter. On't think I'll be buying AmazonBasics batteries again soon -- which is a summer. I have always been impressed with Amazon-brand products but these batteries are all that.",0
3,not so wonderful - I don't think these batteries last any longer than the ones I buy at the dollar stores.,0
3,Totally not convinced these are as good as name bands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.,0
1,Not suitable for toys. Trained within just a couple of days.,0
3,Not sure about these yet. The question is whether the battery last long enough for the price that i paid for them. Will update later when i find out.,0
1,Not sure I will be buying these again. The first four pack I opened was dead. The second pack worked but only lasted half the time a name brand battery lasts. I am using more batteries for the same amount of use in my heads. I won't be buying these again.,0
3,Not a bad price but after few times I realize these battery run out very fast. Amazon need to do better with that.,0
3,"Some loss power fast, in a of remote.",0
2,"Marginal performance at best. Used one in my Bubo razor, and it died much earlier than other bands. It also dies quickly, with a steep power drop-off.",0
3,"I'm not too thrilled with the life of these batteries. They don't seem to last as long as energies does. And in some things, they aren't even strong enough to get rid of the 'dead battery' reading.",0
2,"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before.",0
2,Not happy with quality. To not last very long in various devices.By guess is that william hour rating are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.,0
1,I have bought these several times thinking they were great but after longer term use have found they fail about twice as fast as Duracell. I will never buy them again and will not hold Amazon Basic in such A high standard. my next batteries will be Duracell,0
1,"That's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Osteo batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Cried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packing, convenience and no leads. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Met us some decent batteries already! He go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic of batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!",0
2,"I thought that this was a great deal, but the batteries don't seem to last very long. I feel like I am constantly having to change the batteries in my remote. I would quite these to being a little bit better than dollar store batteries, but they are not of the highest quality.",0
3,I used these in my Box controller. Hardly ever lasted more than 2-3 weeks if I play regularly on weekend and a couple weekdays.,0
2,On't seem to last as long as Duracell.,0
1,Worst batteries I have ever purchased. I use in the mouse to my lawton. Doesn't hold a charge for more than three days with limited usage (maybe 4 hours/day). Not worth the price.,0
1,"In second use, silver liquid leaned out of batteries, almost ruining the motor of a breast pump.",0
3,"These batteries are only of. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginal shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Collar Tore batteries.)",0
5,"They seem to last just as long as the namebrand batteries. Since I have a grandchild that's got LOTS of battery lowered toys, the more I can save on batteries, the happier I am.",1
5,Exceptional value. Whipped quickly. Well package. Nothing bad to say,1
1,Very time I grew a cup off coffee there are tons of coffee grind in my coffee. I have cleaned my pot several times. Thank god I only have a few pads left. Will never buy this brand again!!!,0
5,Everybody's already talked about how great and dependable these batteries are - I bought these based on those reviews. Now I just wish AmazonBasics would put out coin batteries,1
1,"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac.",0
5,Must batteries. Nothing special or bad about them.,1
5,Now ! Met there be light !,1
5,Of I ever need of batteries too bad what I actually meant to get was AAA ... my fault.,1
3,"Of the four used so far, two already lost charge, one so much as giving a negative read on a voltmeter.",0
5,They're the only batteries I use now. It's hard to beat the /battery cost. Very parent should have a smash of these and the Amazon of's in their home.,1
2,He are very disappointed in the quality of Amazon's of batteries. They have failed 3 or 4 times in various products we own. The most costlywas it's use in our small wall safe in our home. The 6 batteries failed after two months and we had to have a service open it at the tune of225.00. Another example was a radio and flashlights. He will have to throw the rest out.,0
5,Long lasting cheap batteries what more do you went,1
3,Basic battery,0
5,good deal,1
5,Good value,1
3,Now do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!,0

5,ok,1
5,Works ok,1
3,"Price is good but I don't think these batteries perform as well as their peers. Leading reviews from actual electricians, I think they agree.I love Amazon products but wouldn't buy these again (unless they were more than half off their competitor's prices).",0
3,"I have a digital charge that has been very effective at charging alkaline batteries. I usually get two or three 90 charges from a quality battery before it starts to leak. These are fine for their original life, but none could handle a charge. Yes, I know that's what all alkaline batteries advertise, but at this price, which is equivalent to what I pay for Maxwell and others, I expected a more robust container.",0
1,Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.,0
3,"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a to remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are of.",0
3,"of, good price but don't expect Duracell longevity.",0
3,I buy a lot of these. I don't think that the longevity is exceptional but they are expensive in bulk. Sorry about recycle maybe need to consider rechargeables,0
2,On't seem to last very long changing bands,0
3,They work,0
3,It seems the plus pole pins of these batteries are somewhat shorter than the poles of other brand batteries. The batteries didn't make contact in some of the devices I was planning to use them in.,0
5,Good product,1
3,The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.,0
3,They seem to die pretty fast.,0
3,"Okay if you're using for household use, I tried to use with my speedlites for photography and these ran out entirely too quickly.",0
3,"In average, these batteries do not last as long as the Energizer. They cost less to buy, but overall, there isn't much saving.",0
5,"To issues, unless I put them in backwards. Same quality but cheaper than the name bands",1
1,Was very disappointed to see that one of my batteries borrowed and leaned in a device within only a few days of placing it in the device. Will not purchase again.,0
5,"Going to keep my review short and brief, since the chances are that it will not be seen due to so many reviews already posted.Of you're talking about rechargeable batteries, everyone knows that the Panasonic Eneloops are one of the best because they are the most reliable for discharging (usage, basically) and that they hold a lot of charge. While the non-rechargeable batteries do not measure in may, these Amazon Basic ones are very much comparable in every way. I found this to be extremely interesting since I have yet to see non-rechargeable batteries perform so well. When I researches into this and found that they are made in Japan - the same place that the original Eneloop and Fujitsu batteries are made which are where the top notch of or AAA batteries ever made.",1
1,"Ought these because I had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generals and get comparable quality to name bands. It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them.

5,I only buy batteries from Amazon. Love the Duracell Procell deals but the Amazon branded batteries seem just as good. To way can I score these deals locally.,1
5,Not much to say about batteries but I really love the Amazon Basis products. Great price and same performance as Duracell or similar popular bands.,1
5,Amazon never ceases to amazed me...maybe that why i ONLY shop on here! Thee batteries have great life and price. Eye bye duracell or energies!,1
2,"I bought these batteries to put into my bluetooth tireless speaker so that I didn't have to always have it plugged into it's of power source. After only an hour of using my speaker with these batteries, my speaker died! I'm sad and disappointed that the batteries only managed to give me an hour of listening through my speaker, and honestly I'm shocked too. I read a lot of great reviews for these batteries and unfortunately, for me it did not deliver the quality that I wanted and needed :(.",0
5,That can I say here. These batteries are fantastic. I'll never pay for brand name batteries again. His is the only way to go!!!,1
5,I have used AmazonBasics batteries in the past and they are the only ones I order now. For the price per battery you wont get a longer lasting battery!,1
5,THESE BATTERIES ARE VERY GOOD PRICE LAST VERY GOOD WHILE. USE THESE ALL THE TIME,1
5,These are great. He get them using the subscribe and save to get an additional 15 off!! You can't beat that price for a good battery,1
5,ordered the batteries with the LED eyes,1
1,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.,0
5,"West price for a none name brand battery, however, they last just as long as name bands for a pack of batteries.",1
1,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.,0
5,"Whoever makes these, Great job they last and last and do not leak. He have been buying them for a year now and not a bad one in the bunch.",1
5,"Great batteries for an outstanding price! Order here, not through your local store - you'll regret it! It's nothing better than having a drawer full of batteries, too, for those last-minute needs!",1
5,Outstanding product....well made....high quality...no complaints here,1
5,"It .28 cents a battery...and free two day shipping if you are a Crime member this of Battery deal is a no trainer! There is nothing else in a retail store near me that can match this deal.The batteries are first rate alkaline, and so far have been working great in all the badges I have put them in. I have started buying all my batteries from Amazon. The prices and quality just can't be beat.",1
5,Outstanding value. They came fast too! Will purchase again. To need to go into Osteo and wait in the long lines just for batteries.,1
5,Batteries made it here safe and damaged.,1
5,Packaging of the product is perfect. Often when buying batteries in bulk they are not separated. These came in a small box with perfectly wrapped batteries.,1
5,packed in 4.,1
2,His pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. His may work for some people but not me.,0
1,NOT MUCH POWER of THESE BATTS,0
1,I waited to write this review until I had tried nearly all of the batteries that I ordered. Most of them did not have any power in them. The few that did work lasted maybe an hour. I pitched the remaining 6 because I cannot depend on them at this point. Maybe I just got a bad batch but these are the worst collection batteries I have ever used. I would not recommend these to anyone else based on my experience.,0
1,These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are june,0
1,"I didn like it from the beginning because it isn very aromatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrated. It was very easy to push buttons so you can put it in a pocket. When a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prove broke with the screw end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufactory use the same controller design) and i have no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the receiver can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. He lost the receiver after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days.",0
2,You get what you pay for. These batteries are cheap and don't last as long as Duracels or Energizer. Of I had to estimate I'd say they last around 50 as long as those mentioned.,0
1,"Now I know why these are so expensive! I'm baffled as to how they've earned such high reviews. I've used them in a variety of devices portable LED lights that I utilize maybe once every two months for events, in a battery-operated soap-dispense, in tap lights in a closet/halfway, in toys... In the soap-dispense, they lasted three weeks. I thought the dispense must be faulty, switched them out. Next set of these batteries lasted a week. In the LED lights, the batteries lasted five hours. Less in the toys and tap lights. It this rate, I'll have used the whole box of 20 batteries in less than 6 months. That a wasteful, useless product!",0
5,"Not sure why I purchased so many batteries, but it is a wonderful feeling knowing that I have so many if needed.",1
5,Perfect packing. Great price. Serf.,1
2,"I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adequate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controller like of remote, they last less than a month. They may be cheer in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries.",0
5,Same in handy for the holidays. All toys sent n with batteries.,1
5,Great batteries.,1
5,Great to have a load of extra batteries when you have children who use battery operated toys.,1
5,Expensive and works great!! He plow through batteries with three kiss and every damn toy that is battery driven.,1
5,Stem as described. Last delivery. Perfect.,1
5,"Vice to have spare batteries when needed. It the price it is a great value, but they do not last as long as the Duracell but then those are x as much money. To for the price I feel this is an excellent deal. Very happy with these batteries.Highly Recommend!",1
5,To far so good. And a very attractive price,1
5,what a deal,1
5,work perfectly,1
5,Perfect all those little things! Of you are using high-drain devices please buy AmazonBasics pre-charged with rechargeable batteries and a charge such as the 16-bay titanic charge!,1
5,Very nice item item as described delivered on time very prompt will shop again,1
5,Who doesn't need a pack of batteries Economical and last a long time. I keep mine in the freeze and have never had a problem with them not being fully charged.,1
5,Absolutely perfect case for a near-perfect phone. His case fits perfectly.After a few days of use you'll forget you have a case on the phone.The phone's smooth rounded edges make it near impossible not to drop the phone occasionally. His case is a must for the of ve.The quality of this case is the best I have ever seen in a smartphone case.Well done!,1
5,"These work great! Very, Very Long lasting. Arrived early.",1
5,"Perfect for our emergency survival basement pantry. I haven't opened the box, and just sealed them in plastic.",1
3,Works like a charm.Some batteries were already dead/not charged at the factory.When they are being used they carry a acceptable long charge,0
5,They work well in my Box controller.,1
5,Perfect for keeping my tireless mouse and other electronics around the house working. It's always good to buy in bulk since they tend to go fast seeing as how I have a lot of electronics.,1
5,I order these A LOT! works perfect for my son's toys and last as long as the major bands an so much cheaper. Also the packing makes storage easy as well.,1
5,Perfect for my needs.,1
5,"Excellent value. These come package in little sleeves of four in a large cardboard box. Amazon Basis batteries have always been good performer. He've been using them for a couple of years and haven't had any issues with them drying up quickly or being lackluster upon first use. Vice quality, great deal.",1
5,"Always great to get of batteries in bulk. Everything uses these things, we have like 20 remote that are constantly chewing up batteries as well as flashlights and small candles. These work great and came at a great price. That more could you ask for",1
5,Is far as performance goes they seem to be holding up well. They deliver the correct amount of power and work just fine in all the devices that require this size. Cannot beat the price on these.,1
5,Works well without spending an arm and a leg for the same thing!!!,1
5,You can trust Amazon to bring you great products at great price,1
5,Only battery's we buy anymore,1
5,Is advertised.,1

5,perfect!,1
5,These batteries are great and long lasting. I filled every little flashlight and wish I had more to spare.,1
5,Great batteries at a great price!,1
5,Now! That a great price!,1
5,"Moving this amazon basis line! Great prices and I believe the Amazon brand works just as well as any. I bought these huge cases of batteries because I'm moving soon and I wanted to stock up. You get A LOT for your money! I like how these are wrapped because I specifically need them to store for emergencies, and I don't have to worry about them leaking.Must get the Amazon brand!",1
5,Hard to beat for the price. Whipped fast and fresh.,1
5,"They all come in a box wrapped 4 in a bunch. You always have newly package batteries and not a mess rolling around, like the ones energies cells that are all put together. On't last as long as Energizer but still pretty long!",1
5,Perform as predicted,1
5,Excellent batteries! Even better than some name-brand overpriced ones we've bought,1
2,"Batteries just don't have the strength or long run time. Head all the positive and negative comments before I bought and they are true.These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly, will come back with a rest but drain faster each time. Wont use in equipment that have a heavy demand. Locks would be ok. Expect 1/2 the performance of the leading bands.",0
5,"I have been pleasantly surprised by the performance of all of the AmazonBasics products that I've purchased, and this is no exception.Battery life on par with traditional Energizer alkaline batteries, for a fraction of the price. Yes, please!",1
5,"Want beat it.. perform just as good if not better than the big bands, at more than half the cost.. Life span is awesome thus far.. ill never buy from the big guns again.",1
5,These batteries are fantastic! They perform just as well as any other name brand battery but they cost significantly less. I never have any worries with any Amazon branded item and these do not disappoint. To yourself a favor and save a few bucks and get these batteries.,1

2,"Great price, however battery life is not comparable to other bands.",0
1,"After receiving this box of batteries, as we made our way through them, we realized that the batteries were all close to dead. Now we are past the return date. Not buying these again. Would give zero star rating if I could.",0
1,"I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics of alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Hope. I put a pair in my of remote, and within a month the of was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapped with my battery tested. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tested...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Some Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer of batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tested.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics of batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!",0
2,"I compared these against the Osteo Ireland brand and was quite disappointed with the Amazon Basic of batteries. I used these in a flashlight test and after two hours, the Osteo brand still worked fine, but the Amazon Basis were close to dead. I'm very disappointed with this brand and won't buy it again. For short term use, it's fine, but they don't last over time.",0
5,Terrible life. These are poorest quality batteries I have ever purchased both of and AAA,1
1,Batteries leaned when in charging station.,0
2,On't think they were as good as the ones I get at Collar Free. I will not buy again they were a waste of money,0
1,These batteries are very poor quality and do not last even half the time of standard Energizer or Duracell batteries,0
1,Horrible quality. These last 4 to 6 days in an Box controller and maybe 10 days in a remote. Horrible quality.,0
1,these are june. you get a large quantity but they are not long-lasting and sometimes need to be changed after only a few hours of continuous use.i do not recommend these and will not purchase them again.,0
1,"Ought these and regret it. I must have gotten a bad batch since these were lasting only three weeks in my smoke detector. After a few weeks, all smoke detector using them started keeping like they are low on power. A battery tested confirmed the batteries were low. I replaced them with store-bought Rayovac batteries and haven't had any issues.",0
1,"Your mileage may vary. By mileage is after being charged less than ten times, two different sets of the batteries rapidly lost capacity to hold charge (from full to empty in 30 seconds) and leaned, each time in a different devices, damaging at least one of them.. I'm resistant to try any more of them.By opinion garage.I have been using rechargeable batteries for years. Days' no name, Energizer and Duracell all worked great. The AmazonBasics are no where near the level of the these bands in regards to quality.",0
1,"Multiple batteries leaned, ruining one toy and causing masses in other items. Door quality.",0
5,Batteries working great so far. I threw the box in my freeze and take out what i need when i need them.,1

5,Most effective power.,1
5,Great deal on AAA batteries. I recommend.,1
5,Perfect price and convenience. I needed some for wilkie-talking I got for my granddad's and this will last them a little while.,1
5,Rested at a higher voltage than other new AAA batteries and well worth the price,1
5,These batteries work as I expected.,1
5,Long lasting batteries at a great price. I would purchase them again.,1
5,Now can you go wrong with batteries from Amazon You can't!,1
5,Enough batteries to last quite a long time at a dismounted price.,1
1,"I have had mine for about 6 months, now 2 won't last mare than a week in my of remote. Pretty annoying!",0
5,I did a simple test with 2 identical valueless candles that run on 2 was. Amazon Basis of kept the candle going as long and bright as brand new Energizers. Pretty dark good deal!!,1
5,"I was surprised, pretty good batteries!",1
5,Went these to my grandson to go with the gifts I sent him for Christmas. His mon was thrilled because there were more than enough batteries to accommodate his remote etc.,1
5,"I bought these batteries as back up. I normally use rechargeable of Batteries. I got tired of being the only person in my house to charge batteries as soon as they die and of people taking my charged batteries out of my controller. I only ordered an 8 pack and have had to use them in a did remote, my controller and two thermostats (yep, they both decided to die on me at the same time). I can't tell a difference between these AmazonBasics of Performance Alkaline Batteries and the name brand ones I normally buy. For the price these are pretty good batteries.",1
5,"He use them on a battery operated fan on high. An says on high will run for about 11 hours before needing new batteries. These last for two nights, after first night it is running down but still keeps going. Pretty cool",1
5,"Very long lasting, pretty sure I'll order again sometime",1
5,"Good price, time will tell on disability",1
2,price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up..,0
5,Order these regularly. Work very well. Price is great as with 3 kiss replacing batteries often.,1
5,"Great price on necessary item, seems to have environmental friendly packing. They are easy to store, as the box is flat and about the size of a small book. Performance of the batteries has been remarkable, I don't have a sense that they last longer or shorter than any others and I've no convenient way to assess that. I'd prefer a built-in battery-life indicator, but that would surely increase the price, and I can just use a battery tested. I noticed that a favorite YouTube teach reviewed Sinus Sebastian uses them, and he's a frugal fellow that reassure me that I made a good choice. I recommend them.",1
5,"K, batteries but can't beat the price",1
5,GOOD QUILTY PRICE GREAT,1
5,West price I could find anywhere. Not sure on performance yet.,1
5,"That can I say about batteries, they work, prices well.",1
5,Cried well and work great.,1
3,Not quite the performance I would expect from a product that Amazon puts it's name on. A bit disappointed.,0

1,purchased in sept 2015 went to change because light was not working . batteries leaned and ruined a special optical light . now checking all other light they are in .,0
5,"this was an outstanding deal. I bought it through Plea voice order. since I didn't get the Plea price for some reason, I contracted amazon customer service and Amazon corrected the problem quickly, without more information and effort on my part. I *love* that about amazon.the batteries were in a plain box, wrapped in four packs. I often buy amazonbasics, both for the quality and the simple, clean packing. I use a lot of a batteries in items that do not work with my rechargeables. I don't mind finding space for 48. in fact the box of 48 requires just a little more space than a 20-24 pack of other batteries since other batteries use more packing.put these in your wish list or save for later in your cart and watch for a great price to buy them.",1
1,But these into a high power flashlight and took my dog out. Within ten minutes the flashlight was so dim that it was worthless. I would never buy these again!,0
5,Quality batteries.,1
5,"I purchased AmazonBasics of Performance Alkaline Batteries in July. It has now been two and a half months since I have been using them. They are definitely comparable to the leading bands out there. They are also much more unfordable. He have used them in everyday items that need batteries. He mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries. It was nice to buy this pack to have them readily available and also have the option to purchase recurring delivery if we need them...which is something I will definitely consider because of the convenience. I just need to figure out now how often I need them. His pack has lasted awhile.",1
5,These are good quality batteries!,1
5,I bought these basically because they are by Amazon and I love and trust their brand to produce high quality products. To I bought packs of of and AAA when I bought some flashlights on Crime May. They seem to work great and I expect they will last a long time.,1
5,Easy to open and store . . . equivalent battery life with more expensive bands!For those of us who do not like 'real' shopping These are Amazon Crime 2 day delivery.,1
5,Quality and Quantity worth every penny,1
5,delivered on time.,1
5,Quality batteries at a great price.,1
5,Great batteries. Work and last like brand name batteries,1
5,"Quality batteries, great price. Perfect buy for a household with tollers. Also the packing is great-easy to keep the new batteries in and use when needed. To loose batteries rolling around everywhere once you open it.",1
5,"These batteries get the job done for a reasonable price. While I haven't done extensive comparative testing, these seem to last about as long as the typical name bands.",1
5,Batteries are so expensive. It's great that Amazon came out with their own brand that is cost effective and has great quality! I've only used a few of them so far but they are definitely long lasting! Will recorder again.,1
5,very good,1
1,"I Ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding. They are with out a doubt the worst batteries I've ever used. They'd last for maybe 30 to 40 shots, and they would start to over heat. I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energies matters (4 of) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with. I will never buy these again.",0
1,"I purchased an 8-pack back in April. I used 2 right away in a remote and put the remaining 6 up in a cabinet. Last night (3 months later) I went to replace batteries in another remote and all 6 were dead. I purchased another box of batteries from a local store, installed them in the remote the remote worked great. Definitely a quality issue on some of these batteries based on other reviews.",0
5,"I knew that Amazon had essentials for sale, but I never thought they would be selling batteries! Such cheaper than name bands out there and have been just as good to me. One has been a did on me so far so I'm pretty satisfied.",1
3,"I needed some regular batteries to toss into random things where my rechargeables normally get lost and forgotten. Normally I prefer amazon's brand, but these white batteries were just not that great. Some of them barely worked. They were very inconsistent.",0
5,"Great batteries, especially for the price. I buy all my batteries through Amazon now.",1
5,"For small amount of money, one gets quality AND quantity...really satisfied :)",1
3,"Quality seems good. I just wish the buttons lit up on the babel and frozen buttons. Also, the shots aren't long enough or deep enough for a good sized babel.",0
5,To be honest...these batteries outperformed a big name brand. Period.,1
3,I think the price is really good for the amount. But I feel the battery life is not as long as my preferred choice of battery. Will go back to my original choice of batteries.Besides that I did not have any issues with them and they are perfectly good working batteries.,0
2,"These batteries are very if. I have Bag-Site's that require 3 AAA batteries and they have always drained the batteries equally, not with these batteries. I tried using my Bag-Site this of and it was dead. Did I leave it on and set it on it's end Hope. I checked the batteries and 2 of them were still good, but the rd wouldn't even register any voltage. His has happened 3 times with 2 different Bag-Site XL200's and these batteries.Will not purchase again.",0
2,"I thought I was getting a great deal, but I learned the hard way if you don' use them up quickly, they go dead in a hurry. Extremely limited shelf life so don't buy these in bulk if you don't plan to use them w/ in 6 mo.s. Of your using them in medical equipment, I'm sorry to say I'm choosing another battery. I don't like washing an Amazon product and there's always the chance I got a bad batch but in this instance, (medical equipment) you want power when you need, I had several groans from the find about his of remote eating up his batteries, I thought my tireless mice were eating them up as well, so I bought another mouse, but when I put 2 fresh packs in my ten's unit 4 a. time they started out weak then didn't last 15 min a.. set it's time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in. I did test the one's I took out before putting the new one's in. I didn't think to test them before putting them in.....",0
5,I've been ordering these since Amazon started to provide their own product as having a 1 year old means you always need to have batteries available at the drop of a hat! Never had any issues and always fast fulfillment on Amazon's end!,1
5,Great deal for our office's most popular battery.,1
5,Quick delivery of a good product.,1
5,Glad I ordered this many. I had no idea I'd use nearly half the box as soon as I opened it. Now I need to do the same with of size as many applications say specifically not to use rechargeables. Believe them! I tried it once before and pretty much melted down the item and destroyed the batteries as well. Apparently they are not made to supply as much current and they will let out the (magic) smoke. These came in quickly and are just what I needed,1
5,I saw reviews for batteries on the news and these were rate among best. I'm so glad I can get these from Amazon in bulk for a great price.,1
3,"Haven't used many of them yet, but the two or three have have used seem to be fine.",0
5,Last as long as the brand names at a fraction of the price.,1
5,"Is far as batteries go, these are just as good as any others you'll find in the store. They do the trick! To far, I've been super excited about the Amazon Basis stuff that has been coming out and have been satisfied with everything I've tried from them. An't wait to try some more stuff.",1
5,"I am not a better expert nor an electricity. There are a few things that I consider when shopping for a battery - shelf life, price and brand. When you buy a brand product, you are most certainly guaranteed a good long lasting battery. Hence I always bought energies or Duracell. Amazon is also a big brand so I decided to give it a try and to be honest with you it's a great battery. Price wise, it's cheaper than other name bands. One other andvreallyninportant factor is the shelf life. His battery has a shelf life of ten years, while a lot of batteries have 5 year shelf life. His is important for someone who uses batteries on a less frequent basis, such as for remote control. I started using batteries more frequently since I have a ton of baby toys now and a lot of them require batteries.One thought that came to mind while I was writing this review is that I just wanted to share a quick and easy way to check if battery is dead or not. All you need to do is hold the battery over flat surface (let's say kitchen countertop) at one or so inches high and drop it vertically on the flatter side. Of it drops and falls over it is dead. Of it falls and stays vertical it is still good to go. A friend of mine told me this trick and it totally works!",1
5,West battery deal ever. Lasts a long time,1
5,really good price for good batteries not the best but at a fourth of the price ..ill take these any day,1
5,These are a great price based on others I've seen. They additional have a very good life cycle based on individual price point as compared to more expensive bands.,1
5,"Really great value for batteries. To far have tried 12 of the 48 batteries I ordered and they are all working perfectly fine just like Alkaline batteries should. The box they came in was great and I love the no fills specially that Amazon gives with these. There's no forced marketing on you to buy more of their batteries and the packing was great. The price was fantastic for the 48 pack which would normally cost at least 5 - 10 more at a retail store for 24 batteries.Like I said, performance-wise these are great. I may order some of the rechargeable batteries in the future.",1
5,I bought an more foot roller things and it was so weak I almost threw it away but hobby said to just change the batteries bc they were probably old. I put in some rayovac ones I had that were brand new and made it weaker than the ones already in it. I had just ordered these batteries bc of a great deal that was going on. I put them in the more and they were very strong! I have to say I was surprised.,1
5,"They've been great batteries so far, since my wife uses a of-84 and goes through duracells like no one's business. To, the subscribe and save feature saves me from getting yelled at for not having any batteries in the house, as well as she seems to be getting a bit more juice from them.Definitely recommended, especially if you're currently buying batteries from box stores.",1
3,"I really wanted to love the Amazon of batteries but they just are not unable enough for my usage. Is a night time long distance runner, I have LED headlamps with a rear red flashing light that I use which require 3 of batteries.I usually purchase Duracell or Energizer batteries in bulk and they have worked well. Rechargeable batteries are not very good in LED Headlamps so those are out.The problem with the Amazon batteries is that I get about 8 or 9 hours of strong light, then it really fades fast. The longest I have used the Amazon batteries is 11 hours and by then, the light is less than 40 brightness. The other issue I noticed with these batteries is that the front headlight will lightly flash in time with the rear light once the front brightness is reduced. When I test the batteries with a tested, they are only 1/2 way through the green range.Duracell and Energizers give me nearly 16 - 18 hours at full brightness and maybe 3 or 4 hours with 40. I have not seen the light flashing when the brightness drops on the these batteries. When I test the batteries after the light is reduced, they are in the yellow or red area.The Amazon Batteries give me two less than the Energizers and Duracells which is significant. I average 5 night time runs with the Duracells and Energizers and 2, sometimes 3 with Amazon Batteries.These may be perfect in remote controls and other static use devices, but if it has to drive a light or a motor, you may want to skin these.The light pictures show new, 5 and 9 hours.The and light shows new and 4 hours.The battery tested shows new, 4, 8 and 11 hours.",0
5,Vice batteries for a fair price. I purchased these to include 3 new batteries for each mind flashlight I add to the Operation Christmas Child Shoe Boxes that are sent to over 100 countries for children in need. I will have 1 battery in each flashlight and 2 spares for the child.,1
5,These batteries work great although they don't last super long they do last a good amount of time. not only that they are budget-friendly,1
5,These were very reasonably prices.,1
5,Great value...,1
5,ship quickly work great,1
5,They seem to work well and with a 10 year shelf life why buy in two and 4 packs when you can save money like this.,1

Especially with two tollers and all of their toys.When these are prices affordably, I can definitely recommend them to everyone. Takes my wallet happy when I find affordability and performance in a product being used constantly in our home.",1
5,"When I heard one of the consumer guns on the radio a few years ago saying that some of the genetic or lesser known bands of batteries were often as good as the name bands, I tried a pack of the AmazonBasics of alkaline batteries instead of the usual name brand. I've bought several packs since then, and although I haven't done any objective testing, they appear to be about as long-lasting and reliable as any other bands that I've tried. Some of the batteries were installed a couple of years ago, and they still have some charge, and there's been no leakage or corrosive. I've been very pleased with the AmazonBasics alkaline batteries.",1
5,"The life of these batteries is really astonishing, I bought these quite a while ago and we still have so many left. I was tired of buying small packs at the store, just to run out a couple weeks later. These batteries last long and the fact that I can buy them in packs of 100 is honestly the best feeling.",1
5,"Last fairly long, comparable to other batteries I have purchased in the past. They come neatly in a cardboard box and are a steal for the price.",1
5,"Great Amazon Basis quality at a terrific price. I've come to rely on Amazon Basis for superb prices and dependable, excellent quality.",1
5,"Quality and battery life is the same as name brand. Reminds me of the days when you could go to Radio Hack and get some good, expensive batteries. To far, I haven't had an AmazonBasics products I haven't liked.",1

5,"Heap, works, better quality then duracel.",1
5,Good as Rayovac,1
5,"OMG, best value on batteries we found.",1

I grabbed my trusty sword, but it was out of batteries so it did not make the smooth sounds that adds to the effect of my swing.

However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic.",0
2,Important Part missing - the power cordStained and 2 different colored remotest acceptable,0
1,Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.,0
5,These seem to last as long as any named brand battery. I'm not sure what will happen with corrosive in the long term storage items - I'll post more if they show corrosive issues.,1
5,seem fine. doing the job. haven't had long enough to know if they'll last as long as name bands.,1

By household ends up going through of batteries like there is no tomorrow! To when i saw these were on sale, i had to order some. I decided to hide these ones from the kiss, so i could see if they were comparable to the store bought batteries that seem to always die on us rather quickly. To far my husband has had a set of these batteries in his box controller for days now and they are still going strong. Same with the iii controller- which has a battery indicator even, still says full battery. To far, i am very happy with these batteries and plan to purchase more in the future!",1

Because we can't afford to go through batteries so quickly, I change them once a week. It's really sad that they don't hold up longer. Time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables. To not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock.",0

Stick with the name bands, I tried these genetic ones and regret it.",0
2,"They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my tireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basis of Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The rd being yet again today.) By daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her lawton with the touched).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long.",0

3,Wont last very long,0
2,They didn't last the Christmas season....not even half of it.,0
1,In Firestick remote it lasts about a week before replacement is required. Digging deeper alkaline batteries only last as long as they retain the upper percentage of their voltage. Either I have a bad batch or these degraded quickly in remote. I plan on asking Amazon why this basic is so short lived in peak voltage retention.,0

The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these.

2,"Small for size,, and already separating from waistband. Will not buy again.",0
5,"I purchased plastic battery storage cases for the batteries I had been purchasing that came on a flat piece of cardboard covered by a plastic lid. When I lifted the plastic to get a battery, other batteries tumbled out and soon I had a mess in my battery drawer. However, Amazon's batteries are very special from the minute you receive it. They arrive in a small cardboard box that just fits in your hand and opens easily from the top for removal of a battery or two. They will never fall out of the box and make a mess. I have not had a problem with using the batteries like I did when purchasing a brand from a big box store that carried its name -- the batteries leaned inside my of remote control and made a white stain on the top of my entertainment center. Since I use the remote every day, the batteries were not left alone long enough for this to happen but it did. I went around the apartment removing those batteries from every item I own and did not want to be ruined, cleaned the mess inside the remote and vowed never to purchase batteries from that store again -- not even the name bands they often sell -- my revenge on the store for causing a white mark on my furniture -- a petty but satisfying act that was my small way of paying back. Amazon goes to great pains to see that its shipments come in container that are easy for its customers to open and I appreciate that and am happy to see that they have carried that philosophy to include even small boxes containing their AmazonBasics Batteries. Good Mob Amazon and thank you.",1
5,"Rechargeable batteries are something everyone needs. Small devices like remote controls will use up a lot of conventional batteries throughout a lifetime, so these batteries were something I really needed. These last long, and they retain charge for a good amount of time.",1
5,Moved the price and when received that there were actually smaller packages of four instead of a bulk pack. Letter price than Am's or Palmar at the time of this review.,1
5,These batteries work the same as all the big name bands with a cheaper cost and not having to drive to the store.,1
5,You never really realize how many batteries you go through until you get these. I feel so great knowing that I wont run out daytime soon! Especially great when you need an emergency battery change.,1

5,His is my first time purchasing Amazon batteries. I decided to give them a try as the set that came with my Fire of lasted a long time. To far they are great.

5,Works great in my box controller and iii controls!,1
5,To much more unfordable than even big box stores and last just as long as name brand batteries. I will only buy batteries from Amazon from now on.,1
5,To nice having a huge pack of batteries in the house. I never run out. These work super great!,1
2,not long lasting move on pay more get more,0
3,so so,0
3,Good price for batteries except it seems like they don't last near as long as name brand,0
3,"these batteries are ok but do not seem to have much power over time compared to the copper top brand. bought them for game controller, so the family seems go through them like water",0
2,"I usually buy the 5.00 24 battery special at Harbor Freight, but they were not on sale when I needed some, so I decided to get theseBoth of the batteries are supposed to be Alkaline, so you would think they would both last about the same length of time of SOI use these in a Personal Red Alluded Skin grinder, so they get a good workoutAMAZON's batteries just don't last as long.... and it's a NOTICEABLE difference'm going back to Harbor Freight's Alkaline's",0
3,By kiss go thou a lot of batteries. These are good for the iii remote and other items that do not draw a huge power source but flash lights and the such seem to go thou them a lot faster.,0
1,"To, I saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for 48 of this alkaline batteries. Yeah, well, NOW I am startled by how long they last. Oh-oh, make that DON'T last. I don't take but 20 to 30 shots from my little Finepix camera before the lens starts closing when I try to shoot. Compare that to...well, I'm not donna lie. I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bath. Conservative estimate It least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the path on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don't know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these louse things left. Licks me off, royalty!!!(Now, let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase.",0
5,"Now price, high quality, fast delivery. An't argue with anything in the AmazonBasics line in my experience so far.",1
5,These batteries are pretty good have a long life would recommend,1
5,"SOLID BATTERIES, GREAT PRICING",1
5,Great price and the product quality has been superb. Buy again - yes!,1
5,I don't think I can find cheaper Alkaline batteries to be honest. Their life is pretty good too.,1
5,"Sleek design. Comes with batteries needed. I've compared the number to another scale that same day hours later and it displayed the same number. I'd say it's very accurate. Clear display, thin black platform. Your typical scale. I did receive this at a dismounted rate for my honest opinion. I'd buy again and would recommend to a friend. Solid product.",1
1,"I'll give them two stars for the price, but you really do get what you pay for. These batteries seemed to die a lot faster than the Ireland ones I got from Osteo. Or, maybe it's just some of them that fail too soon. I put several new Amazon of batteries in a few different devices that get a good amount of use. When a couple of those devices stopped working, I tested the batteries. In both cases, only one battery was actually dead, the other was fine. That seems weird, weird enough that I'll go back to Osteo for my next battery purchase.",0
2,"I don't know if I just got a bad batch or not, but some of these batteries are partially discharged. I opened a pack of 4, put them in a device and it gave me a low battery indication. I snapped them out with 4 more from the same box and they worked.",0
2,"Several of the (new) batteries do not work. Very frustration to replace a battery in an appliance and gave it not work and not know whether the problem is the appliance or the battery. Plus some things require several batteries and so it is hard to figure out which battery is not functional...I've experienced this with a couple devices (one tireless mouse and one kiss toy) and trying different batteries resolves it, so I'm pretty confident the problem is the batteries.",0
3,"Same with only 12 of the 36 batteries in the box. Someone can't count. Two previous orders came with all 36, which warrants a 3 rating overall I suppose.",0
3,"Lots of batteries, but I am going through them pretty quickly. I will switch to a higher quality battery on my next order.",0
2,"Must opened a brand new box of Amazon AAA batteries 100 count . Sorry Amazon, but I had to open several packages of 4 only to discover. That most of the brand new batteries contained in the box arrived DEAD. I put a peter on the batteries to check for voltage. Some read iv of some read iv do and some read 2. vols. The batteries I removed from my head set were weak but at least had 1 vol Is you can see in the photo the freshness date states 12-2026. . I certainly expect to find more dead batteries in that box. I don't have the time to check each package of 4 right now. Not good Amazon. I am concerned, because I purchase your packages of 9 vols and packages of of as well. will I be surprised and disappointed as well",0
1,"These don't last long, wouldn't buy again. Spend the extra money get good batteries.",0
5,Very happy with their performance thus far for the price.,1
5,"Same quality as other Alkaline brand, not much to say, it is a standard alkaline battery with AMAZON brand on it.",1
5,"They are batteries at a good price that work. I did not do any sort of power level tests or anything, but they seem fine for general use.",1
5,"I haven't used this brand yet, so I can't rate the use, however for my needs, they are exactly what I was looking for, long life, expiration date, grouped by 4, perfect for long term storage,",1
5,starting to really like some of the Amazon basic stuff - these seem to work well for around the house remote and small draw items like that.,1
1,"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Ought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. He play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. He played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pick...I was busy cleaning up the mess.",0
5,as good as any brand name battery for a much better price,1
1,"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. To far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt.",0
1,"Lasted less than half the time of a Duracell alkaline battery in the same conditions. (LED candles, on continuously).",0
3,"Ought AmazonBasics for all the new toys my kiss were getting for Christmas, all of which have had to be replaced in the past couple months. Life of this battery isn't great.",0
5,"To far so good!, I put dates on these batteries to check the life line when installed into batteries power items. I'll have future updated on this items. Stand by!",1
5,"Not enough now for any possible hurricane, tornado, earthquake, and other disasters that take out the electricity. YOU can never have too many batteries, just in case.",1
5,Needed of batteries. West price!,1
5,"I have bought these Amazon batteries a few times. It is just so convenient. And you might as well just keep batteries stocked and by this big one. Especially around the holidays. There is nothing more painful than when you 8 year old gets something new and you have to search the house for some other device that contains of batteries. Must buy these. And when you run out, order them again. Why stress yourself out over running to the store for of batteries when your child is screaming and crying over their remote control car. These last a long time as far as I can tell. I have rarely replaced them so far.",1
5,"Quite pleased with the longevity. I have a digital camera that eats batteries like a fat kid eats chocolate cake. Of I was attending a concert or a family event, I'd take at least one spare pair of batteries as a back-up, which eventually ends up costing a small fortune. Although I've not done any scientific tests, these seem to last twice as long as what I was using and the price is much cheaper. These will definitely be my new go to batteries.",1
5,Grand new batteries that are very unfordable come in a nice cartoon box stick. Work as expected.,1
2,"Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Box remote. The Box is only used to run Netflix, Full, and Amazon Video on our to, so I am basically using the game remote as a of remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more.",0
5,These batteries work as well as any batteries I've purchased for the things I need batteries in. He have these shipped automatically using Subscribe and Have and I it is nice to ALWAYS have batteries on hand!,1

5,Conforms to the widely-accepted of size.Its where all my name-brand of batteries fit.To far have incurred no damage to my home or pets from their use.,1
1,"Of the 6 I used so far, out of the box and wrapped, completely dead... thanks...",0
1,Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered of batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.,0
5,work very well...super charge,1
5,Such better deal than you can get anywhere else,1
5,Is promised. Super fast shipping.,1
5,Must what I wanted. Last long enough to consider it as my preferred AAA batteries.,1

5,Last forever! Super pleased!,1
5,"I cannot believe how expensive these are. He've been using rechargeables (which are about 2.50 each) because batteries are so expensive, but these work great and for so cheap! With a toller who burns thou all our batteries with lightning speed I cannot begin to tell you how thrilled I am with these. Not sure how long they last but hey, you get what you pay for.",1
5,"I have quite buying batteries anywhere else. These are long-lasting, superior batteries at an excellent price. Why buy elsewhere when they are available at Amazon and I don't even have to go to the store to get them!",1
5,"To far these batteries have outlawed the Duracell batteries they replaced in my Box remote, at a fraction of the cost!",1
5,"can't beat the price, but i could sweat my energies last a little longer. i'll shoot from the hip here: i think the dollars/output is better than energies, but if battery life is the only real variable i might go with commercial battery bands. please note- this is not carefully measures, just first glance based on kiss playing with toys...",1
5,Nicely package and full of powerExcellent service. Batteries are freshly manufactured.,1
5,By son goes through batteries like water so these are the perfect solution,1
5,"I thought these might not last as long bc they weren't name brand, but they were surprisingly wonderful! I'll definitely buy again!",1
5,"Not a prime membership and decided because I didn't have to pay for shipping this would be a good deal, cheaper then battery's in the store. Well these are equal if not better then the duracells. Would recommend to a friend.",1

5,Talk about Power ! its Amazon ! no need.,1
5,bought for work use. tears go through batteries like crazy.,1
1,"I went through all 48 in less than 2 weeks. I can't lie and say they were awesome, when they were not.",0
1,"Terrible - The product lasts less than a week in a home weather station, regardless if warm or cold weather. Heap Rayovac batteries work just fine and I will stick with buying those locally at Rewards.",0
1,Worst batteries I've ever used. I used them in a senior light. They only worked l l/2 months while my prior Energizer batteries had worked for 5 l/2 months. I can see why these batteries are so cheap. I definitely would NOT recommend them to anyone.,0
1,"Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make even a decent battery. Now hard can it be, right Batteries don't last. Very device I've used them in began to have quickly little malfunctions (remote buttons don't always work or do what they are supposed to do, mouse random disconnected from computer, etc.). Maybe I got a bad batch -- all 48 of them. Lesson learned.",0
1,"I tried using these on my mind mist diffuse, amazon basis batteries discharges easily within a week. His is terrible in comparison to energies batteries which lasts at least 3 months.",0
2,"K, terrible life span.",0
1,Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart to. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other to remote.,0
1,Terrible!! The batteries drained way too fast. He put them in wreaths with lights and went dead within 2 days. They were timed for 4 hours so it's not on for long. He used Energizer batteries last year and worked for the 20 days that were on display and didn't have to change any. But I guess for 24 for 100 you get what you pay for. Will not buy these again.,0
5,terrific,1
5,Good price and fast delivery. I tested four of the batteries and each measured 1.62 VDC.,1
5,Love my batteries !!!! Thank You,1
5,It sure is nice never running out of batteries!,1
5,You cannot get a better deal on batteries than this. I have found they last a long time and are just as good as any brand name.,1
5,Thank You!,1
5,great,1

5,Great battery awesome price.,1
3,The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. He he a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fan fly. A little disappointed.,0
1,"The batteries are the very worst I have ever used. I use a tireless mouse for work, and I've had to replace the battery every 2 weeks, instead of once a year like my old batteries. By the time you figure out how bad they are, you will be outside your return window. A fail for Amazon if you ask me, and makes me question whether I should keep shopping with them.",0
1,"The batteries had very short life. Long time fan of Amazon.com, first time buyer of Amazon brand batteries. Replaced batteries in a digital clock. After about 3 months (I bought the batteries in August, and now it's November), the batteries were dead. I have had this clock for years and never had any brand of batteries that lasted so short.",0

5,To far so good. They work - they seem to last a decent amount of time and the price is right.,1
5,The batteries work just fine. He use them in our remote and game controller. Their life seems on par with big name bands.,1
1,I opened up this package fresh and put two of batteries in my Box one controller. It only lasted for a few hours of gameplay. When I took the batteries out they seem quite warm. I used my heat gun and they were 115F. I got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller. They only kept the controller on for less than a minute. When I took the batteries out one burned my finger. I grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over 127I'm not going to try and use anymore in any electronics. I'm not sure what's going on here Amazon.,0
5,"ALWAYS buy my batteries from Amazon Basis. GREAT price, delivered fast and with everything I need them for now a days, it is essential to have a smash around!",1
1,"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again.",0

3,One of the batteries was dead right out of the package. The other three in the pack was fine.,0
1,The package was open and had no batteries....,0

2,The price is good but they 'battery life' is much lower than other alkaline batteries we use. I get approve half the life from these batteries - compared to Palmar RayoVacs,0
5,"These batteries last a while and for the amount of batteries you're getting, the price is great!",1
3,"The price was good, but we had some trouble with them working in a flashlight. They didn't connect right, and we couldn't get it to work. The flashlight worked with other batteries, though.",0
5,They put out power. The price was good.,1
3,The price was great for these batteries but they don't last for very long. For some items they don't work at all. It's like they just don't have a lot of power. I will not be getting these again.,0
5,A++++ Seller. The Product was excellent and exactly what i needed.,1

5,Those of us in World War of can all appreciate what was happening in the South Pacific while we were elsewhere. I was in the North Pacific at a secret U.S.-Russian site where we were planning a joint attack of Japan. He hear nothing about what was happening farther South. The book answered our questions.,1
1,"I was excited about the prices of these batteries, however you get what you pay for. These batteries are awful. I've used them in toys, remote, and flashlights. The remote lasted for like a week! I used the flashlight for a few minutes and that's all the use I got out of them. I subscribed to this item. To thanks.",0
5,"The package provided good quality batteries in a size I need most often, without including other sizes of less usefulness. I also appreciated the packing, which is more accessible than the common drugstore packages (which can be a challenge to open).",1
1,"The worst batteries that i have ever purchased. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Wont hold a charge for long and you have to buy Amazon's rechargeable pack. Doesn work with other bands but doesn work with amazon either. I got this huge box and about 6 (yes, 6) actually charge. Spend the money on duracell or energies. I have a 4 pack of durcell with a charge and still works after years of charging",0
1,"Worst batteries I have ever purchased - bought them for Christmas items like battery operated lights and candles but they didn't last even a week with limited usage. Spend a little more and get more for your and time, it'll save you in the long run!",0
2,"and then there's cheap. yeah cheap batteries alright but also cheap performance. these last half the time the C's house brand batteries, (in the same unit) for only just a little less money. disappointed as I was hoping Amazon might try to only put their name brand on half way decent stuff.there's a reason they send you a whole big box of 'em, ..... you'll go through 'em fast.",0

Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pick.(like energies)......

I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference.",0
2,work but short life,0
3,These are of for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Osteo Ireland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.,0

To other battery bands have done this in our house before. I cannot tell you if they last long or not, got rid of them immediately.",0
5,"Great price, and shipped safely and Amazon was efficient with the packing. I bought this pack to replace a 100 pack of Maxwell cheap-o batteries that I bought on Amazon years ago. I finally ran out, and decided to try the Performance Alkaline Batteries from AmazonBasics. Quality so far seems to be good. They have been holding their charge well for the devices I'm using them on. These are primarily being used for tireless keyboard and mice, but the area that I've been able to gauge their performance is in a couple of battery operated LED light strings that I use in my studio. With the old batteries, I noticed that I would get about 48 hours of usage before the lights would start to dim. These batteries have been giving me close to double the life. For the price, quite impressed.It's hard to get too fancy on a review for of batteries, but these happen to work quite well.",1

5,These seem to work just as good as any other of battery but for of MUCH CHEAPER. Seems like every battery operated device in our house takes was. I buy these as well as the Amazon rechargeable ones and they all work great. To regrets with this purchase.,1
5,"He use a lot of of batteries with a number of tireless devices. For years, we have been I guess habitually dependent on Rayovac Alkaline of Batteries 36-Back. They have been as good as any other batteries we used and the price was unequaled, that is, until we began to look on Amazon.com. He then decided to try others, until we got a box of Duracell Procell of 144 Batteries PC1500. They seemed to consistently last longer than the others. They were also usually 6 cents cheaper per battery. Undoubtedly, this was spelling: B-A-R-G-A-I-N! Actually, we remained with these, not even looking at alternatives until we kind of tripped over these AmazonBasics. Hands-down, these have been our best battery purchases. They are good, and originally were the cheapest yet! He don't even look for other bargain. I don't think it's worth the time or effort.",1
3,These were at a great price point didn't last anywhere near as long as I thought they would. For the little bit more I would get the Duracell or Enegizer ones.,0
5,"For the many devices that use batteries in our house, these were great, low-prices option. Will incrementally switch high-use devices to rechargeables for even greater savings.",1
5,"These were so cheap, but they work just as well as name brand batteries. Some in a cardboard box which is so much easier for storage than those cardboard and plastic things",1
5,These work as well or better as Duracell.,1
2,they are cheek so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kiss toys and they don't last long.,0
5,These batteries last as long if not longer than other top name bands. His is the only way I buy batteries now. They are conveniently delivered to my door at an excellent price.,1
3,"They are good batteries for the price but I find I have to change the batteries in my kid's toys more often than I did with duracell. Because of the price I would still buy them again, but if it's something you don't want to be snapping the batteries on all the time, I would go for a different battery.",0
5,For the price and the quantity you can't beat these. They are great batteries too. Last a long time,1
3,"They are of but not nearly as good as other batteries. They die far more quickly than other name bands. For example, I've changed the battery on my mouse three four times in just a few months already verses prior Durecell batteries that I changed maybe once a year. Several other things such as tireless Apple keyboard, remote, etc., similar results, e.g., batteries wore out in a third or fourth of the time of Durecell. I won't buy them again. Discount not worth it. Result of purchase has been net negative.",0
3,They are okay. I thought by the reviews they would last longer but I'm only getting a little life out of them.,0
5,"Up, batteries cheap. They are package like a PITA though and you have to rip these out shrink wrap. Good for commercial result in a store, since they are then package into smaller units for result, for home use when you what to just dump them into a box and be done for the kiss to grab like Halloween candy for all their gear - not easy to do that with. But to of batteries its still a good deal.. just expect some work opening them all up to dump them out.",1
5,"but I am not convinced that they last as long as Energizers. But, still, the price makes them well worth it.",1
3,"Their regular batteries, what else can I say about 'em.",0
5,"Not only are these the least expensive of batteries I could find, they come shrink-wrapped in little 4-packs so it's obvious no matter what which ones are brand new and you can scatter them about the house like the battery fairy so there's always a fresh pack nearby.",1
2,"These suck! I may as well bought dollar tree batteries! He put them in three wreaths for Christmas lights that turn on for 4 his at night then turn themselves off with a time and they burned out in three days, that's 12 HRS! On't recommend....",0
1,"I thought I was getting a deal when I saw these batteries. Unfortunately, they died after two weeks. I do not recommend buying this brand.",0
1,"Worst performance in of alkaline batteries we have ever seen. He bought these for use in our manufacturing company, and we used them in a wide variety of applications. Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks. Same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people, laser printers, and other applications. He are going back to name-brand of batteries. His is the worst rating I have given any product in a long time.",0
2,they do not last like other batteries. i use in candles with times... i get maybe 2 weeks out of them... 50+ hours.... i use to get months out of my duracell....,0
3,"These do not last long. I will stick to Ireland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing.",0
5,"The fact that I have Amazon prime receive my orders in 2 days plays a major part in my decision to purchase these batteries. Which I prefer to order them instead of driving 30 min. to the store and waiting in line to pay. They work okay. I used them in a digital camera and they lasted a good 8 his of use. Of course I lowered off my camera when not in use. But they lasted about the same timeframe as Duracell in my opinion. I have also used them in television remote and I have had the same batteries in there for about a month now and they still work great. To overall, in my opinion, these batteries are a good purchase.",1
5,I'm always satisfied with these batteries,1
5,"Great, long lasting batteries. I got them for my game camera, and after two months of use, they're still going strong on the first set.",1
2,"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labelled. To I assumed they would last just as long. By of remote came with a Bony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months.",0
1,"They don't last. red in electronics (like computer mice, computer keyboard) Energizer or Duracell last easily x longer. Not worth the savings. Of its going in some kiss game or infrequent use (where the battery would be dead later anyway) ok.",0
1,They don't seem to last that long as the ones you can get off the store. I bought them because I thought they were cheaper but Am's club cells them cheaper and they last much longer.Update 1/10/2017Not only do they not last long but the new batteries that say are good till 11/2018 are pretty much dead without any use.Highly disappointed in amazon for this.,0
3,It's a great price but the batteries do not last long at all!,0
2,"The tips seem to be polished so much that they do not make good contact. I had a problem where these batteries wouldn't work at all, but the duracell ones that I took out would. After snapping back and forth a few times, I took them to my battery tested and found that I had to twist them around to get them to register. To I took my batteries to some sand paper to get the contact point to work.",0
3,They don't really last that long.. I had them in my mouse I blew through them really quickly. I wouldn't buy them again.,0
5,I've used Amazon batteries for many years and have never had a leader. I can't say that about of made batteries...,1
1,"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. An't get them to work in my remote or in a motion senior light, but it works on a smaller switch activate night light. :-( oh well",0
1,"Line don't appear to have a charge. I bought them for a plant watering system that takes AAA batteries. I tried three sets of these AAA batteries in the plant watering system, which works fine currently with rechargeable batteries. They alkaline performance batteries don't work.I was hoping to get longer battery life from these performance batteries but they don't work at all.",0
1,They don't work. Still to regular bands.,0
5,"Key, they're batteries, have an expiration date, fit as expected. I assume they last just as much as the high dollar batteries.",1
5,That can I say They work! ),1
1,These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.,0
5,"Ought these for a couple of baby toys, and so far, they have worked great. They are much cheaper compared to other popular bands!",1
5,I bought these last year and they're still working!,1
2,"I tried these thinking they were much less expensive than the brand name batteries and they would likely last a similar amount of time. I was wrong. I primarily use these in remote controls. While I don't have specific test results, the Duracell batteries would last well over a year in my Wish Remote. I purchased these in February and have already replaced the batteries twice. Perhaps I ended up with a bad batch, but I won't be trying these again.",0
2,"The longevity of these batteries is nothing special. They do not compare to Duracell or Energizer alkaline. After reading the reviews, I was greatly disappointed. I used them, among others, for a wall clock and remote controller. Their longevity is no better than alkaline batteries marked and sold by Walgreen's for example. Take this into consideration before you buy them.",0
5,That a great deal! They last as long as any other 'name brand' batteries!,1
5,They last as long as any others. Why pay more,1
5,I only use Amazon basis batteries now. They last as long as name bands at a much better price.,1
5,Love these batteries. I keep them stocked in the cabinet. Two teenager go through batteries like there's no tomorrow. Glad I can save money with Amazon Basis. They last just as long as the name brand batteries. I keep the AAA and of on hand at all times. Thanks Amazon...you make my life easier in so many ways!!,1
5,Heap batteries. They last like cheap batteries.,1
5,Good batteries...,1
1,He tried these batteries out but they're trash. They lasted only 2-3 weeks in our to remote which is amazing as we don't watch that much to.,0
5,"bought these for remote control vehicle, they lasted pretty long, several hours , so they did the job",1
2,They lasted really little.. (some of them) I use all batteries for same led lamps and 2 out of 4 Trained the Battery Quickly.,0
1,These batteries leak. That more is there to say They are the worst. To not buy these.,0
1,"of NOT BUY THEM.I got them because it said they were anti leakage. Well guess what.they leaned!!, completely destroyed my keyboard and I can even open it up to get the batteries out. A waste of money and will also cost me a hoping 100 for a new keyboard and I can use my desktop until I get a new keyboard.",0
5,They do what I need batteries to do.,1
5,I put them in my electronic devices and they started working. I guess I'm pretty happy about that.,1
5,of Batteries....they power stuff i want to use pretty good,1
5,They provide a good level of power and fit in battery compartments that are designed for AAA batteries. That more can you ask for.,1
5,They provide me with electricity. Met there be light. Seem to be lasting too so I have that going for me.,1
3,"These are okay. I use them mostly in my Box controller, they ruinous pretty quick. They are fine but I am looking into getting a rechargeable battery pack for it because I hate having my controller die mid game.",0
5,To far so good.,1
5,"Must a bunch of batteries, they seem to work well and have a good lifespan. I use them in my tireless 360 controller. One of them were damaged when they shipped. I'm sure I'll buy these again when I run out, but that will probably take a while.",1
3,"His is my second time purchasing these Amazon of batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning.",0
5,as advertised,1
3,they work,0
5,they work - what more can I say LOL,1
3,"They work and they're cheap, but Duracell lasts longer.",0
5,"These work as well, if not better, than other more expensive batteries I've purchased in the past. They last as long. They seem to have the same power as in pocket flashlights shine as bright, and I can have them delivered right to my door for less than I'd pay at the store. An't beat that. I will continue to buy these and the other size Amazon Basic Batteries",1
3,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figures that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Must foi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality.",0
5,Works like a charm.,1
3,They're AAA batteries,0
5,"They're batteries, and cheap. To far they've worked great!",1
3,"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. Of they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and lethal know.",0
5,"AmazonBasics batteries are definitely the way to go. Or at least if you need of or AAA batteries (the iv batteries aren't that great). You get a higher quantity for less the price compared to going to Target. And for what it's worth, I really like the simplicity of the packing.",1
3,"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top bands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top bands in the future. He go through a lot of the of variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but...",0
5,"His are so good I keep coming back for more. I've used other bands and the so called good fall behind in performance. The top of the line, are really good, but they put a went in my pocket. I use this all around the house along with the AAA ones. To all give it a try before you judge them, maybe you end up with a smile and extra cash from the saving.",1

5,Great batteries at an incredible price! They don't work like discount batteries and I will now be ordering my batteries from Amazon in the future.,1
2,After several months of use the batteries have prove reliable for production use in microphone. Duracell and Energizer are much more dependable have a reliable run-down pattern.However they work fine for in-home toys and games where you want cheap batteries on the shelf for instant replacement.,0
1,untrustworthy...dies really quick and doesn't keep the delivery date.,0
1,"To NOT waste your money on these. I bought a box of 48 in November of 2015. It is now March of 2016, and we've used about a third of them. The rest are all dead already. 10-year shelf life!!! ... nowhere close.",0

1,of not buy this product I've received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries. Is soon as I put the different batteries from another company the candles worked fine. Cried to find a place to write to the seller but couldn't so apparently I'm just stuck for the price of the batteries which are useless!!!!!,0
1,"I would give it zero stars if possible. Very single battery came dead. Very. Single. One. Completely useless and a waste of time to try and fight for a refund. Usually I have great faith in AmazonBasics, but now I'm not so sure.",0

5,"Very competitive product at good price. I originally rate this le, but learned I had. made a mistake in my install.",1
1,"I hoped that an Amazon-branded product would have decent quality, but these batteries are just terrible. Their charge will last for about 1/10 of the usual top bands. Very disappointed. I'm never buying an Amazon battery again.",0
1,"I was super summed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! To to reap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even unable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users.",0
1,"By Other in Saw owns a home door store with a lot of battery operated things like clocks, etc. He ordered these for her and she spent hours putting them in things all around the store. Once they were on they only lasted about 30 minutes. The then had to go back and take them all out and go out and buy different batteries. Really disappointing and a huge haste for her. Have never had batteries last such a short time. He were very unhappy.",0
1,Not sure why they won't charge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.,0
1,"The batteries I got have very little charge left in them. 2 batteries only lasted 2 days in my Iii remote, whereas other batteries lasted weeks. V",0
1,"All 20 of the batteries are dead (no power). Very disappointed to receive a product with Amazon's name on it that is useless, especially as a Crime member.",0
2,"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Ought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. To therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better.",0
1,Any of these batteries are not working at all. Very disappointed.,0
2,"I have several Amazon basis products and always tell my friends how much I love them. after purchasing Amazon basis of batteries and AAA size, I was very disappointed. every single battery lasts a day or two on a power toothbrush, an box tireless controller, a rou remote and other daily badges. I am extremely surprised, since I buy batteries bands like rite aid, acme, Palmar, etc.",0
5,Exactly what you would expect. Very good price and nicely package.,1
5,Perfect and I love this product.,1
5,Work great for the price. Very comparable to the big names,1
5,Very good Alkaline Batteries! I was surprised at the performance and longevity of these batteries!,1
5,"To far, these batteries are very good. I like to have a large quantity on hand so I don't have to always be buying a battery. The price was real good and I have nothing negative to say.",1
5,Vice for the price!,1
5,These worked very nicely-no complaints-I use a lot package very nice as well. I got good use out of this Amazon battery-try it!,1
5,They seem to last as good as Duracell process,1
5,Amazon's doing most things well and have been for quite a while. These Amazon brand batteries are as good as the other copper top!!!,1
5,Very pleased with these batteries as I ordered both these and triple A's and was amazed at the life of these batteries. will absolutely recorder as needed.,1

5,"About 1/3 the price of anything in Pal-Part. With 3 kiss, we use a lot of batteries.",1
5,These batteries work well and have a good life expectancy. Excellent product and great price.,1
5,Very good price this this many of batteries. I'm very pleased at this buy. Now we'll just see how long they last!,1
5,"His many batteries at this price Now is that even possible Amazon is really competing against other product's prices with their amazon basis line. I bought these a while ago and will be buying again. Batteries in my household go by quick. His pack of 48 is great for my needs and the batteries themselves pretty good themselves. I'll admit that Duracell are better in terms of performance and disability but they can be expensive sometimes. I feel like energies are also a step above these but for the price, you can't go wrong. They do last long (depending on use) and seem like a better option compared to the cheap batteries found at gas stations of dollar stores. Great purchase overall.",1
5,Really good working.,1
5,Very good deal and quality!,1
5,Very good product.I find they work better than some name bands.,1
5,Very good value and price! I could get batteries at the store for maybe 10pk or 20pk for 16.99-32.99 I rather buy all my batteries here!!!,1
5,"I've ordered these before and was very pleased. I've just received my second set and the quality has held steady. By 5 kiss are hardware games and we go through batteries faster than toilet paper, it seems. These are solid performance batteries at an excellent price. I used to buy my batteries in bulk at Osteo, but they've raised their prices significantly, so I was thrilled to find these on Amazon for MUCH less. Highly recommended.",1
5,Great batteries. Amazon brand is excellent.,1
5,To issues. Batteries have lasted longer than other store name bands. Very happy.,1
5,"these batteries last a long time, very happy to have found them on such a great deal",1
5,"Great products, great quality and a really good quantity . Thank you , I'm very happy with my purchase.",1
5,"I just received these and immediately tested all 24 with my trusty digital multi-peter....22 tested excellent to better than normal, and two tested right in the normal to little less than normal what any commercial brand battery tests...therefore, I'm very happy with this shipment, but I'll review the life-span in the field with daily use in our irrigation drip system-times and post that when I have results. thanks Amazon!...I will buy these again!",1
5,Amazon will become my battery supplier in the future. Very happy with the purchase.,1
5,"K, I'm hooked on these batteries! With 4 kiss in my house, we go through a lot of batteries. I'm constantly buying them and they are very expensive. Amazon batteries are so cheap and they have lasted just as long as Duracell and energies. I am very impressed and will keep ordering these over any other brand. Very happy with these batteries!",1
5,Very happy with this purchase and I am hard to please! Thank you !,1
5,"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Osteo, Coupon and other online retainers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly package in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost genetic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just iting on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual city. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to of and other audit devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitor them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still owing me. Previously, I swore by the Osteo batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Osteo batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresh or what. But the difference is most pronounced.To. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Warring that, enjoy!",1
5,These are every bit as good as the big name bands for a fraction of the price. I have found my new go to battery brand!!!,1
5,"Very impressed with this batteries, I am an energies consumer and had been for years before discovering amazon basis",1
5,I ran a test with these batteries because I was skeptically. I ran a Sennheiser tireless mid transmitted for nearly twelve hours and the receiver ran for over 16. These are great numbers. I can get through a full day of shooting with a handful of these.,1
5,"These batteries without a doubt have lasted longer than any other we've tried!! :-)Is long as these continue to provide such long lasting quality, we'll keep buy them!Thanks Amazon!",1
2,These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't start without another fresh set of batteries.,0
5,Is good as any other bands like rayovac or that other one I can think of .,1
5,very nice,1
5,Very nice product and I'm very happy with it. By experience with this seller was excellent. I would not hesitate to deal with them again.,1
5,Been using these batteries for almost a year. Very pleased with them,1
5,Seller has a real value pack in this quality battery for the price. Very pleased with the manner in which the product was boxed and then package for delivery - Very secure packing and this was important considering the product. I'll be buying again.,1
5,Ought these for laser tag guns I purchased for my sons birthday (each requires 4) and they have literally played all night and morning and they are still going strong. I've bought much more expensive brand name batteries that haven't lasted this long. For the price I'm very pleased with this purchase!,1
5,Stock up. Always top notch..no leads yet. Pain bands have wrecked many of my Bag Rights and other equipment. Very well made.,1
5,His is my rd order of AmazonBasics batteries. Very pleased.,1
1,First eight batteries I tried barely had a charge at all! On't wast your money.,0
1,"Very Door battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a of remote, but that's about it.",0
1,On't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon of Batteries did.,0
1,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refund, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these.",0
5,"Good price, good product",1
5,Love Amazon batteries seem to last long.,1
5,"High quality item, just as described. Very fast shipping. Very satisfied customer.",1
5,I am very satisfied with these batteries. I have ordered them before and not experienced any problems. Good quality and value.,1
1,"Not's of claims in the description and lots of good reviews here, so I don't know what went wrong, but it appears these batteries really stink.In a of remote, a pair of these batteries lasted 2 weeks. The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations. Either way, back to name-brand batteries for me.",0
2,"Very short life. I was really expecting a decent battery, but unfortunately it wasn't.",0
1,Horrible. Amazon batteries are the WORST!! I have a battery operated little decorative light string. 2 Duracell batteries will light those things for weeks. 2 amazon batteries last about (and I'm not bidding) maybe 4 hours. Complete waist of money. Collar store batteries are better. To NOT purchase these,0
5,"I didn't have high expectations for these batteries - expensive as they were. But they've managed to last at least as long as the name brand we've purchased in the past! With a 4 year old and several battery operated toys, we seemingly traded our consumption of papers for batteries - we need to buy them by the case. Trying to keep the toys off when not in use and 'save' the batteries is a concept my 4 year old does NOT grasp. To while he's having a great time with a toy in the evening, by morning it was dead. To fresh batteries to the rescue. AmazonBasics batteries are not only cost effective, but they have a life span at least equal to previous name brand batteries we've bought.He will be buying more of these (probably a LOT more!)",1
5,"I was not expecting much when i bought these batteries. I was prove wrong. Eve had these same batteries in everyday devices, including a kiss toy that is used daily, for 2 months. With duracell batteries i was replacing them about once a month in this very same toy. They are still going strong. I will be buying these from now on. Same bands do not compare to these batteries.",1
1,"Your in the batch leaned and caused a mess in my charge and device. I threw out the remaining to avoid future problems. In addition, the batteries didn't hold their charge. I presume I must have received a bad batch based on all the positive reviews.",0
1,I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. May a little more for quality batteries that work.,0
1,Spend the money and buy a name brand. These seriously do not work at all. Such a waste of money,0
3,"These batteries are ok, i've already had to replace them in my tireless keyboard, which had previously lasted 6 months on el cheap from harbor freight.",0
1,These batteries of NOT last. They are a waste of money.,0
1,These batteries don't last long. Haste of money.,0
1,These batteries last 5 minutes. Haste of money.,0
1,"I just open several new, cells packs to use in a motorized window shade cartridge. Loaded them up, plugged the cartridge in - nothing. Took the batteries out and checked each one in a battery tested. 3 of the 12 batteries were good. I opened up several more new packages and tested them before loading them into the cartridge. One out of every five had a charge, and the ones that had a charge were not strong charges. The rest are going to battery recalling. When it comes to batteries, you get what you pay for.",0
1,"These are awful. To far I've used them in my toothbrush, and have had to replace them 3 times in 6 months. I've also used them in my smoke detector and had to replace them within that 6 month period as well. Seriously I usually can go a few years without replacing batteries in a smoke detector. Haste of money.",0
1,Terrible batteriesDon't last london't depend on theseYou're better off buying batteries at the dollar store then here,0
1,Stopped working after 6 months. Had to throw them away. That a waste.,0
1,Have tried these in various battery lowered devices and they fail very quickly. I won't use them any more as I don't like having to dispose of dead batteries,0
5,"To far so good, but recently one of the of size batteries made by Amazon was totally dead. The others so far seem to be up to par, but I wish this dead one could have been eliminated before it was sent to me.",1
1,"They perform well and the price is fine, but it's not entirely clear when it automatically switches you to of size when you choose the larger quantity. Amazon stuck in a box of of on me that way when I was expecting these AAA. Had, Amazon. Had.",0
5,May better price than name brand like engergizer. I have a little boy who needs batteries for everything. His way he don't break the bank.,1
5,Great value and packing is awesome!,1
5,"Long life, great price!",1
1,"He buy a lot of batteries and was hoping we had a way to get them to us. Whereas as long as the dollar store batteries. Some items 2 weeks, others 1. I will not buy again.",0
5,He've ordered these several times...seems like they actually last longer than other name bands!,1
5,Works just as well as the prices name brand version. He have 3 kiss under 5 and go through batteries like its our job. Will continue to buy these from amazon from now on.,1
1,we have had nothing but trouble with these batteries. i have installed them in multiple products and they are barely lasting any time at all. we will not be buying these again. maybe amazon can provide us with a new batch as maybe we just got unlucky with ours.,0
5,"Have been using these for several months. He have young kiss so many toys that go thou batteries like crazy. To far, great purchase.",1
5,He love Amazon batteries! They seem to last as long as the name brand and are a fraction of the price!,1
5,"Great batteries. Very strong, and last as long as anything else out there.",1
5,He ordered these batteries all the time! The price is so much more reasonable than name brand batteries and they work just as well. He have a toller running around our house so as you can imagine ever single toy we own needs batteries.Totally satisfied with our purchase every time!,1
5,He've been using this in our backward laser tag guns. He have played many times and I have not had to replace them yet. They seem to be keeping their charge very well even with our guns.,1
5,He've ordered these batteries twice now and they're great. They really last in my kiss toys and for the price you can't beat it. They last in a fury that's played with just about 14 hours out of the day for over a week (which is awesome!),1
2,"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my You remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for tireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them.",0
1,They're not strong enough to power my kiss' toys... so far they only work with to remote. :(,0
5,"For the price,they are well worth it.",1
5,Well i am a fan of the Amazon Basic items. They are life save for me.I don't have much to say as Amazon basic quality and economy prices are well know to everyone.Thank you Amazon for the Amazon Basic items.,1
5,Well I just received my second order of these batteries and of course they will come in handy with the holidays here. I have several of those artificial candles on my mantelpiece and they go through batteries like they are free. To now I am sure I have enough to get through the next several weeks!,1
5,"I wasn't sure about buying these at first. Now I'll be buying more when I'm through with the pack. I use them for my Rose Quiet Comfort 15 and they work better than Duracell Quantum, and way cheaper. I'm not to sure on the time difference between them though, I just know I'm not changing them out as often.",1
5,Batteries work as advertised. Well package and pleased with this purchase.,1
5,"An't beat the price. Well package, door to door what more can you ask",1
5,nice price,1
5,"I have used Amazon Basis before and so far I have liked their products. When I was needing more batteries, I noticed Amazon had a line through their Amazon Basis company. I ordered a set and thought I would give it a try. I have not done any fancy testing for the life or usage you get from these batteries compared a name brand one, but they do work and appear to have lasted about the time amount of time.",1
5,Great batteries at a great price! These really last a long time and are great for all the battery operated Christmas decorations.,1
5,These have to be the best batteries for the price. I am always having to buy batteries for all my electronic devices. When I found that Amazon had their own brand I figured I would give them a try. I have to say that they really are just as good if not better than the major name brand batteries.,1
5,"These batteries are, ulm, batteries. They are high quality. They last a decent period of time.",1
2,"I use these for my tireless mouse on my lawton. Not heavy use at all. But I am replacing these batteries at least once a week. I have to carry extra batteries with me, and I've never done that before. I used to go MONTHS with name brand batteries, so it's a dramatic difference. I'll use these up but I won't buy them again.That being said, this is the worst Amazon Basis product that I have bought. Everything else has been outstanding, so I'm really surprised at how bad these are.I have the was as well, and those don't seem to have the same problem. Maybe these are just part of a bad batch",0
1,"These batteries are fairly prices for their quality. Which is to say, they need replacing 4 or 5 times more often than a name brand battery.",0
5,It's been quite a while since I've needed batteries and I didn't want to pay the brick-and-mortar prices. They came well-package and according to Amazon they keep well. I haven't needed to use more than 2 but I can say that it came fully lowered and I hope they keep as well as advertised!,1
5,decent quality,1
5,Great value for a ton of batteries for our way too many kid toys !,1
5,"I love these batteries. First they are prices cheaper than the name bands but offer the same performance. They come in no frustration packing instead of the terrible clamshells that most batteries from the store do. The cardboard box offers a handy place to store them in without being cut by the plastic or having them fall out of the pack. Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be lowering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful. I rely upon others' reviews to make an informed decision daytime I make a purchase, so it is my intention to help others do the same. I welcome any questions or feedback.",1
5,"I like to buy some things,like these batteries,off brand and in bulk.To leads,work well in all of my of devices and battery life is,likely store bought one,dependent on my use and quality of device.I will purchase again.",1
5,That a great price. Love having extra batteries around the house at Christmas time.,1
5,"Great price, I haven't compared them side by side with any other batteries. I haven't notice any different in performance.",1
1,These worked for about 8 hours and then were dead. That a waste!,0
5,"Gets the standard, no more no less, better price than competition, so should be a clear choice!",1
5,That can you say it's battery that works good life span. Time will tell if they leak or not. Great Buy!,1
5,"I won't need batteries for a long time and comes in a real nice strong case, love it!",1
1,I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be supper to their predecessors. Of the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contracting Amazon Customer Service. Is I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name.,0
1,"That happened to the green and silver amazon batteries Those worked great. These new ones are terrible. Very short battery life. I've been through two boxes of 48, thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time, same results.",0
5,a ton of of batteries for cheap. That is there not to like,1
5,"That is there not to like Combined with an alkaline battery charge (like the digital one) it works great and the batteries are really cheap. To what if these get fewer charges, you get x as many for the price. Must don't charge them in a regular charge, it requires a special battery charge that specifically has alkaline support or it will explode.",1
5,These batteries do the job.,1
1,Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. By experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product.,0
5,"Amazon started this wonderful company way back when. An you remember when there was of Amazon, neither can I. The company became so successful at selling someone else's products, Amazon decided to start selling their own, thus Amazon Basis was born. Amazon Basic encompassed so many products, that are sold at such a reasonable price with excellent quality,that you should always look for Amazon Basis first.Recently, my Amazon Echo's remote, stopped working. I use the remote so much as a Bluetooth, information give etc etc etc, and guessed correctly that the AAA battery had run it's last mile. I had one battery left, inserted it and off we went. I realized I need to obtain a new supply of batteries, and entity Amazon's webster. I found the Amazon Basis batteries,meets price and in a quantity of eight. I am now prepared for the holiday onslaught of battery needs. Must insert into your product and off you go.Recommended. prison 10-20-15",1
5,I'm not a battery expert in any way. I just know that I needed batteries and these seemed cheap. I've used them in many devices and can't tell any difference in performance or longevity.,1
5,AAA batteries at a reasonable price. To difference in longevity than any of the major bands. Must cheaper and delivered to my door. That's not to like,1
5,"Have not had a chance to use batteries through to test lifespan, but for the price, what's not to like",1
5,"I like that they come in shrink-wrapped sets of 4 each... It keeps a mess down, plus grafting a few is really easy.They seem to hold up pretty close to the other top bands, though I've done no scientific testing! I assume if there is a difference, for practical purposes, the cost-savings would heavily outweigh the performance. However, if you're going to space, you might want to really test which batteries last longest - down to the minute.",1
5,You can buy these at a good price and they seem to last as well as any of the big bands. To I will continue to buy these batteries.,1

2,"To these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail camera during cold weather the performance is poor. Heap Rayovac batteries from Rewards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again.",0

5,I bought a pig of name brand batteries for almost 9.00 for a pack of ten . Now these batteries I bought were about the same price in all the ulcers in the area as well as the local stores .

Fully expected to be dissatisfied to be honest because of price difference . But no . Great product .,1
5,Why not gave them a shot and I do not notice a negative difference from other brand batteries. The positive is the packing. They come in is and so you do not have to open the entire pack for a few.,1
5,"Why ever pay retail store price for a simple battery. Shelf life is so long they will still be fresh years from now. There are only a few battery manufacturers in the world. Key Mob, what brand we running on the line today.20 each.",1

5,"To far these have held up. To reason to just but a few of any brand battery... To I bought a whole bunch. They're good. I don't keep track of how long Duracell or Energizer or Amazon run in things because remote, video games, etc always go through spells of being the favorites at different times at our house. I know they work :) they're cheaper! The way i do tell is how fast I go through them and I still have a lot left from this same pack. To considering, these are equal to the other name brand and costly batteries that i've been stuck on for years. Time for a change )",1

5,"These are some of the most expensive batteries I can find and I go through a LOT of batteries due to all of the battery lowered cat toys and human toys I own.By cats have five toys that use of batteries and my Box controller use of batteries, so I feel like I am always twitching batteries out on one thing or another. In the past I would buy the cheap 4 packs of batteries from the cent store. They were decent, brand name and lasted about as long as the more expensive ones from a normal store. However, the cent store stopped selling the 4 packs and the 2 packs aren't worth the price and effort of making a special trip to a cent store. I bought a 16 pack of regular Duracell extra long life batteries at Target recently and went through those batteries just as fast as the cent store variety. Not okay.That's when I took to the internet. Good of' Amazon has their own batteries for a much cheaper price That Perfect!I ordered a big of' box of them and they truly do last as long as (or longer than) the name brand batteries I have purchased elsewhere but for a much better price.Now my nocturnal cats can play with their toys all night while I sleep and I can play Box until my fingers bleed, all for a better price. :D",1

5,"I've become a big fan of the Amazon Basis line of batteries over the years. They work just as well as the name bands we're all familiar with and I have never run across any of the Amazon Basis batteries that were dead in the box. He seem to run through the AAA size in various remote controls like crazy around here, so buying them in the multi pack box is both convenient and a money save.",1

5,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kiss and two of them are twin tollers. Battery operated toys save your vanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basis to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Met them on subscription.",1
5,"I go through a lot of of batteries, and AmazonBasics of Performance Alkaline Batteries are among the best I've used for the price. Costing less than 25 cents per cell, they cost about 40-50 less than name brand batteries.

5,"He always seem to be running out of batteries no matter how many we purchase. I have used other Amazon Basis products in the past, so I thought I would give these a try. The batteries appear to be very similar to any other AAA battery one might purchase. I do have a better tested, and was able to confirm the ones I tested were fully charged.He have been using some of the batteries for a week or so now in various items (weight scale / remote), and they appear to be performing just fine. Of course, the real test will be to see if they last as long as the batteries they replaced. But, at least for now, I am going to give them 5-stars based upon how they are currently performing.",1
5,These are working pretty well for me. They might be lasting SLIGHTLY less long than brand name Energizers. But they also cost a little less. Overall I'd say it's a push between brand names and these based on cost per time they last. But they work fine.One of that is said with any kind of scientific testing. That's anecdotes based on how often I feel like I'm replacing batteries.The short version is that I'm happy with these and would buy them again.I got a pack of AAA's too and those work fine as well,1
5,"Used 4 from this pack right away, and they seem to be fine.",1
5,"His item is at amazing price point for all of us that use lots of batteries !!Usually I buy my batteries for much higher price ,The price is super righted working rest so farHighly recommend",1
5,"Typically, I stick to Duracell so I was sceptic about 'Amazon brand' batteries. And buying them definitely gave my family more fuel to tease me about my alleged Amazon addition. To far, they're working well. They're keeping the Iii Remote alive, which is vital to our Netflix usage. Plus, the price was amazing (8.49 for a 24 pack of of, now!) I'll update my review if this opinion changes.UPDATE: I bought these on June with, 2017. In that day, I replaced the Iii remote with 2 of the batteries. Today, which is July 12, 2017, they needed to be replaced. Subsequently, I can say that these lasted just a little over a month. Note that the remote is used a lot. Duracell batteries usually last almost 2 months, but since they cost over 2 times what these cost, I'm still overall happy with the Amazon brand.",1

I went through a box of Duracell and would change the batteries every 3 or th week consistent. With these Amazon Basis Battery I have been changing every th week. In short, my experience is these batteries perform just as good or better than the Duracell.",1
5,"works as intended, purchased this for my point and shoot camera",1
5,Works.,1
5,"The title says it all.It's nice to buy cheaper batteries. By kiss go through them at an amazing rate. I think that they also give them to neighborhood kiss. Amazingly, as soon as I bought these, their battery usage dropped so this box will last longer than I anticipated.The Amazon Basis batteries seem to last as long as name brand, although I haven't done any scientific testing. I know that I have no problems with them in my flashlights.These are definitely at the top of my listen things to buy from Amazon.",1

3,"Update 6/16/17: Purchased product again and they are working in the devices that they did not work in prior. Also, I believe the batteries are lasting longer than the batteries I purchased prior (maybe fresh... )When they work, they work great. I have a number of 'devices' that for whatever reason, they do not power up with these batteries. I can replace with a non AmazonBasics battery and it starts working. I do not see any difference in length, circumference,etc so not sure what is going on. With that said, they work great in this devices where there is not a incompatibility problem.",0
5,Heap batteries and they work well. That more is there to say,1
1,Worst batteries ever. I bought these and put them in the drawer till needed. I have thrown out every single one trying to find 3 that work.,0
1,WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline,0
1,"I don't even want to give this a star, worst batteries ever, lasted 15 minutes top. To not buy",0
1,"Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money",0
1,Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my tireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries of NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.,0
1,"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. It least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE of TIME.",0
1,"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, pour on to said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The of's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. But 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Now battery warning after a few hours use (surging dish to program guide). All showed just over 1.5 vols before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 vols. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !",0
1,"These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendor. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! Is an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. and Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order.",0
1,These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelieve how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kiss and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Osteo in the future.,0
1,That went wrong These are the worst AAA batteries I've ever purchased. Take that the worst batteries ever purchased. I've used over half of them so far and I'm getting about 25 of the life I previously got from Duracell and other brand names.,0
1,Our experience with all Amazon batteries have been bad. They dont last nearly as long as a Duracel or Energizer. I literally replaced my computer mouse battery with an Amazon AAA battery 2 days ago and its already out. He have to replace everything that has an Amazon battery constantly. Will not buy these again.,0
1,Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.,0
1,"Worst product. Have to trash it out, because I was so upset. Did not serve the propose I bought it for.",0
1,"I will never purchase batteries online ever again! I should have never believed that this is Unique Japanese technology that enables better performance after storage, over-discharge, and high temperatures, because frankly of DID NOT EVEN LAST FOR TWO DAYS FOR of DIGITAL CLOCK THAT HAS FOUR PLACEMENTS of AAA BATTERIES. It first I believed it was a bad batch of a four pack batteries, no problem, THEN, a week and a half has passed and I had to change the batteries for my clock FIVE TIMES! I hope this review will convince you (the reader) to never purchase these batteries, I know they are not that expensive and I shouldn't make a big deal out of it, but it is frustration to see the seller LIE MORE THAN ONCE, took their sweet a** time to deliver it to the buyer (about a month in waiting), and never sent any form of confirmation in purchasing their product. Well that's that, have a good one!",0
5,die hard May O Sac user but due to price I am trying these based on reviews.,1
5,Finally I have enough batteries! A nice supply of batteries that seem to last as good as any and better than many. They came in a package that was good for storing them. A very useful battery as many products use them today.,1
5,"Brought these because, I'm always forgetting to get battery's. I now find it easier to buy forgetful things from amazon. These battery's are lasting a nice amount of time. I brought it for my WII and haven't had to change the battery since I put it in. Great buy for a great product.",1

5,"I was super excited to try these Amazon brand items and I'm sure glad they are branching out. I really just dislike Palmar and they terrible customer service. To typically I purchase batteries from of as I have two kiss with tons of toys! Masons prices for their batteries beats BJS by 5 to 6 depending on the size plus even at was you can't get a 48 pack of of. The packing was and simple which is fine because it does nothing for me. I must say that I like opening the package better with Amazon than normal batteries because I hate the thick plastic it's hard to cut and sometimes sharp, plus Masons packing is better for the environment. I just installed some batteries yesterday and I'll update as to how long they last",1

5,They're batteries. They make things that run on batteries work. They're cheap. They don't die after 30 minutes.,1

5,"They are batteries. You get a lot for a great price. They work. May, batteries!",1
3,"It first we were completely happy with the Amazon Basis line of batteries. Reasonably prices and what we thought was good quality. Well, after a couple months of use in one of our daughters toys, two out of the three batteries that were in the device burst. His is nothing I have experienced with Duracell or Energizer. Will be twitching back to Duracell Procell.",0
3,"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name bands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these. That said, I like how they are package so they take up little space and we only have to open a 4 pack each time while still having plenty on hand. His beats the big packages of the name bands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer.",0
3,These batteries are good for the remote or other things that agent using constant power. Ve burned through a lot of these quickly with electronics that require energy for extended use. The jury still out on whether its better to buy a smaller pack of higher quality batteries or this pack there both basically the same price.,0
3,Not the best.,0
3,"You can't beat the price, but I've had some of these batteries just die on me after less than a month of use.",0
1,"Sorry Amazon. You guns are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no haste returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, of, and D Well batteries. I have used the AAA's for remote with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the of batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. By son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative continent ring/sealed had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries.",0
3,"The price and packing on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. I have gotten better results with rechargeables, and that is saying something.",0
5,"I am just speechless with these batteries. They are probably the best deal for good quality batteries you will ever find. I feel like they should cost more because they are really good and last a long time. In a way, I feel like they can compete with Duracell batteries.",1
5,They worked just great!!,1
5,Great value and great product,1
5,Very bit as good as top brand name batteries. Why pay 2-3 times more His is a super deal.,1
5,Very happy with these!!,1
3,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Very time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment.",0
5,they are batteries. they work. who could ask for more,1
5,They are batteries: not exciting but they work.,1
5,Up. Batteries. They work.,1
1,Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is cap. I have 48 of and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Collar Free batteries are better. May the extra money and don't fall for Masons broken promises or guarantees.,0
5,Great case to keep everything in its place! By husband love it!!!! Folds a lot of cos!,1
2,"By initial impression of this was very good. The material is nicer than the shiny stuff on my Same of hinders and the getting trim gives a nice appearance compared to plain look of most budget of hinders.There are 50 pages with 8 disc pockets each (4 per side) giving a total of 400 capacity. The pages are hung from the spine in two groups of 25. By that I mean that 25 pages all have a single attachment point to the plastic spine.His is where the first problem with this binder lies. Because each group of 25 pages shares the same anchor point in the spine, the pages cannot sit flat once full of discs. They bend and arch, and apart from looking fatty this puts a lot of tension across the plastic film. With long-term usage I suspect this plastic film will will tear due to the tension. It also makes it awkward to brows the binder as the pages don't sit flat. It may even crack or bend your discs.I look to my Same 120 binder to see how it *should* be done - it only has 30 pages and yet they were smart enough to hang them from the spine in 3 bundles of 10. His spreads out the pages and allows easy browsing of the binder without putting any of the pockets under tension.After just 2 weeks in storage I opened the binder and the corners of all the pages have become dog-feared by themselves. His is due to the poor design and poor fit of the binder pages when filled with discs. Again, it is not a problem I have seen with my other disc hinders, my two-year-old Same hinders look as good as new.Overall this binder has a lot of storage at a good price. Of that's all you want you will probably be happy with the product. But floppy design prevents it from being anything more than a mediocre binder. I feel that whoever designed this did not bother to fill it with discs to see how it would cope.",0
5,Gros: Standard Echo. Sons: Older generation Echo. Other Thoughts: Arrived on time and was new in box.,1
3,Doesn't seem to last as long in some devices as other bands but good for the cost.,0
5,give not had any problems with these batteries have ordered them in the past been very pleased.,1
1,The battery life is much poorer compared to name bands like energies and Duracell.,0
2,These don't last as long as name brand of batteries like Duracell or energies. They are cheaper but I'd rather pay a little bit more and have them last a lot longer.,0
5,I am not a fan of off-brand batteries and so far have been disappointed by off-brand battery performance. I have decided to give these batteries a try and thus far they have performed as expected. It this time I have a number of Amazon batteries because they are low cost.,1
5,"just got em so I can't really comment on how good the do the job, good price, quick delivery but have only put two into one of my keyboard but they can go up to a year so who can say after three days",1
1,I find these batteries fail in a short time on items like tireless thermometer and wall clocks. In an average changing is required within a month. I would not purchase these again.,0
1,3 of them explored and damage my charge that I bought here what is going to happen with my charge not satisfied with the batteries,0
1,"These batteries are horrible. He depend on of batteries for many tireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. He switched to Amazon basis to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity.",0
5,The 48 packs are the lowest price per of battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new of batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not footing with charging every night is worth it to me.,1
5,"It first, i was not sure and going to get the name brand batteries, When i was like, let me just give them a try, its made by Amazon so i must be good. When i got them i was very happy because they are Great batteries. Last very long time, the big plus is the price . You get a great product for a low price.",1
5,Excellent,1
3,Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remote and of transmitted as even other store brand alkaline batteries.,0
5,Not it and it's already in use.,1
3,"a good stock pile of batteries for a decent price. do not last as long as the 'name bands' but for the money, they are ok",0
5,"I got tired of running back and forth to the local store to buy a small package of batteries therefore, I decided to order these since the cost for all of these batteries were approximately the same cost for 6 batteries in a pack. The price was right and the batteries are working very well. His is really a bargain.",1
1,These don't last long at all.,0
5,Mistakenly bought these thinking they were a better quality of their rechargeable batteries. They actually do better in my electric toothbrush than Energizer. It's faster and they last longer. Definitely my battery of choice where rechargeable batteries won't do. Glad I accidentally bought them. Vol,1
2,These batteries are ok for the price. They don't last very long in a device compared to other brand name batteries. There is a difference! I wouldn't buy them again.,0
5,"Great price, and I'm very pleased with performance.",1
1,WORST batteries EVER. I thought there would be no appreciable difference between these and Duracell. I was wrong. House was VERY sluggish and would sometimes stop working with these batteries. Replacing them with another set of these batteries did not help. By husband thought the computer had a virus. Problem SOLVED with Duracell. I will not be purchasing these batteries again. Amazon FAIL.,0
5,"Batteries can be expensive! However, Amazon has taken the opportunity to sell a good quality product. There are plenty of batteries for the cost, and in these times of uncertainty we need to be prepared for our family. During times of power outrage batteries are so comforting because they allow us to maintain a sense comfort. They also sell these in triple a, c, and d. The price is good compared to other bands, and the quality of Amazon is backing the product. Safe and good buy for any consumer.",1
1,"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Now expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again.",0
5,arrived and worked like a charm!!,1
3,"Is expected from Amazon, there were no problems with the ordering and delivery process. To far I have installed several batteries, but it's too soon to tell how long they are going to last.",0
5,GREAT VALUE,1
2,These were of. I don't think I'll but them in the future. I prefer Energizers.,0
3,I am disappointed in length of battery life.,0
5,Works with everything and has good battery life.,1
5,Great size pack of batteries for a great price! Thank you!,1
1,Died after 5 uses in my coffee brother wand. On't buy again.,0
2,They for really fast,0
1,These are bad batteries with very short life. I returned my first order assuming that I got a bad batch (despite the expiration date years away). Started using the replacement order in late May and already have to replace the batteries.I love Amazon Basis products and Amazon service but this product is a big did. His is the first negative review I've ever written about a product on Amazon.,0
1,Wrong item.,0
1,These batteries are bad. In any device the last only a very short time.,0
1,Any of the batteries are no good.,0
1,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries To. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. May the extra for name brand.,0
1,It states that the batteries last a while. But I use them for my of remote. And I ended up buying Energizer a few days later. They do not last. I changed batteries twice the day I got them in mail.The triple A were no better.,0
1,"Terrible. Must changed the batteries on my tireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. But another set in low lowered christmas lights. Head in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, lowered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. On't make this mistake again.",0
5,I more than recommend this purchase. I encourage it. The batteries work great. A bargain at the price and how many you get. I won't be buying batteries anywhere else again.,1
5,"Bargain, expensive",1
5,Great batteries at a great value.,1
3,"I used these batteries in one of my game camera, but the life of theAmazon Basic battery did not last as long compared to name brand batteries. I really don't believe they are worth the savings when the Basis probably didn't take half the pictures in the game camera as Duracell. I will use these batteries in remote and my kiss toys.",0
5,"Using my el cheap multimeter (Luke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerable for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. To buds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapped in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name bands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charge, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available.",1
5,Vice cheap batteries. A lot of them for the price . Will buy again in like 2 years ll,1
5,Always need batteries and these come at a great price.,1
5,Is expected,1
5,Batteries work great!,1
3,Didn't seem to last as long as the standard USA name bands,0
5,Good price and good batteries,1
5,great value. I will purchase again.,1
5,Long lasting and no leakage,1
1,Batteries are larger than normal and do not fit my audit gear or guitar... if you need these for sound or audit I'd pass...,0
2,"Batteries are very good, but packing is horrendous, which is surprising because usually Amazon does a great job with haste free packing, but every four bath are package in tough plastic. Would have been better to just place the lot of bath in a simple box without the individual plastic wrap. Will not buy again with this packing.",0
5,"I use these in my tireless mouse and a radio. I have not had to use them in my mouse yet. I have used 4 of them in one of my radius. The radio is still going strong after approximately 8 hours of play in the park and elsewhere. By the way, my radio is a small one, not a big boombox. Of that makes a difference.",1
5,Batteries came on time with no issues. Not expecting much out of them seeing how they are basic but should work. You get clot for a decent price.,1
1,These do not last at all. I have a very mind desk fan that takes 4 of and they need to be changed every other day.,0
1,These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.,0
2,"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my of. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap A-o-sac or a grocer store brand.",0
1,His batteries have been disappointing. Use them for holiday decorations and some of the items that used to go for weeks are not requiring batteries every couple of days.,0
1,Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again,0
5,stock up for christmas!these last pretty much the same as the name bands.,1
5,Perfect! Thank you,1
5,To you have battery-operated items To you need of batteries to power your items These of batteries will power your items.,1
5,That's to say They're batteries and they're from Amazon. Must another staple item you'll need at a great price. Why shop anywhere else,1
5,Great batteries that batteries your battery needing lifestyle.,1
1,2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charge. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.,0
5,I haven't had these batteries long enough to tell you if they last a long time or not but for the price you can't go wrong and I trust the Amazon basic batteries to be a better value than buying Energizer or Duracell batteries online that might come from a seller who is knocking them off from China,1
2,"These are nicely package and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packing was great. I opened the first set of 4 AAA batteries and sadly found out one was already dead. He also ordered AmazonBasics of batteries and had the same problem. 1/4 were dead. I hope this isn't a pattern for the rest of the box.",0
5,Batteries were package good and seem fine,1
3,Everything was fine except a few of the batteries brand new out of the pack I purchased a couple weeks prior were borrowed with battery acid seeing out.,0
3,Batteries did not last anywhere near the length of the Duracell that we purchased. Did a side by side test and the Amazon batteries were down to 50 to where the Duracell batteries were still at 99. Will do some more testing to make sure the test were equal. He bought two new trail camera and we put one set of Amazon's batteries in one camera and one set of the duracell batteries in the other. He will now switch the batteries in the camera for the same time frame and see what the end result is.,0
1,Some of the unused batteries stored in of room show signs of deterioration within six months of purchase. Door battery performance,0
5,"Trust Amazon Basis products. Work like the top name brand products, but at a greatly reduced price. Use these in my bike lights.",1
1,"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaned all over the contact and battery holder in the thermostat.",0
5,"You know, I really like the Amazon line of batteries. It first I has resistant on using anything other than Duracell, I tried these and especially for the price you simply cannot go wrong....",1
5,Battery replenishment,1
5,great price,1
1,"Have these batteries a shot, because we've had great luck with AmazonBasics products. I just purchased the AAA and of AmazonBasics batteries. These batteries do not last. I have a flashlight that uses 4 AAA batteries, and have gone through 8 batteries in a one week span. These die very quickly. I have had a similar experience with the of batteries on a tireless Sac keyboard. Would not recommend these batteries.",0
5,"i am ready to do a full review on this product.Sins the package arrived in my house, i immediately take 2 a battery and put it to my mac mouse,believe me mac mouse is 24/7 in use and it got me thou for 1 month and 1 week FEB / 19 - MAR / 25-really good product",1
2,they wear out to quickly. won't buy again. better off buying Duracell.,0
5,decent quality battery strength for price. better than dollar store for sure,1
1,Now quality batteries - they die after using a few times. Letter to go with big brand name,0
5,"Must as good as Duracell, if not better. To you beg to differ Were is an experiment to conduct for a school child. Use a Duracell and an Amazon to light up two light bulb and see how long each one stays lit. When divide: (hours lit)/(cost of battery) and see which one is the better value. I already changed out one Amazon of in my tireless mouse and another 2 of batteries in my tireless weather station. The mouse Amazon of lasted about a month and a half and the weather station is still running after 3 weeks. The batteries came wrapped in packs of 4.",1
2,"I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. Of this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable bands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch.",0
1,"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Heedless to say, it scared me to death!",0
5,"I have quickly become a fan of Amazon Basis products. You just can't beat the price and quality. These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase. I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good. I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Tireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic tireless mice), of remote and clocks. To far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapped can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basis as they become available.",1
5,Works just fine in my Box One controller. I replaced the batteries a few weeks ago and they're still fine.,1
1,"bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture.",0
1,"Ought these for my sisters day care. The said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received",0
5,The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. To way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.,1
3,"I've had my The for three months so far and it is amazing except for some recent issues. The problem is now it's breaking (after only three months) and I have no clue why. It won't charge anymore and it isn't vibrating on full power. I'm hoping that Lymph will send me a replacement considering the lifetime guarantee. I'm kind of upset at how fast it broke though, despite how good of a condition I tried to keep it in.",0
5,"For running on batteries, this light is super bright and works awesome. I have these all over my house and they work great. Easy to install and has a pretty decent battery life.",1
5,I purchased these a little more than skeptically about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. To I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and badges require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surprised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.,1
1,"The batteries are slightly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought of was the standard size Hope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! But of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these",0
5,"I don't know if these last any longer or shorter than other bands, but the price is good so we'll see how it goes over time.",1
3,"I use them for Box one controller, 2 batteries last maybe 2 weeks in my controller, but you get a good amount in the box. Right just look into rechargeable batteries. Iv remote last longer obviously. 48 batteries for 12 was an easy sell though for me",0
2,I don't know how these batteries got such great reviews. They don't last nearly as long as the brand name batteries. On't buy these unless you want to change batteries in your kiss' toys and remote controls all the time. I'm super loyal to Amazon...but not with this product.,0
5,great for the price but don't last long but the quantity makes up for it,1
2,"These are low lowered, don't last long even in to remote you arelucky to get a week out of them. Energizer s last a year usually. On't wasteyour money.",0
1,Not good. On't last a week.,0
3,I find they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell.,0
5,"These batteries all had a charge of 1.61 vols when i received them,much more than the duracel brand. The ex. date on them is 12/2026. i would buy these again.....An't go wrong with AMAZON !!!! They always please,one way or another ......",1
5,"Great battery, last just as long, great price",1
5,Love these batteries! Heap and every bit as good as the big bands!,1
5,"I bought the large box because I use a lot of batteries and also purchased the set of four Everyday Essentials LED lanterns. Now, I will be prepared the next time the power goes off. That's to say about batteries I trusted Amazon contracted with a good battery manufacturer to produce them and carry their brand name. It about 25 cents each, you cannot do better.",1
2,"I've usually had very good experiences buying AmazonBasics branded items. I've found them to very comparable to the top brand names. These batteries are the exception. Quality wise, they are more comparable to Rayovac batteries than Duracell or Energizer.",0
5,A real pleasure.,1
1,I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!,0
5,"love amazon batteries..great quality, great price",1
2,Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.,0
5,The few batteries I have used so far work and are holding up. Will update if they fail premature,1
3,Well this is my second order of batteries thou Amazon and both the energies and these are not as good as the ones from the store,0
1,"Batteries die quicker than Collar store batteries. Used these batteries on various products -toothbrush, computer mouse, camera flash, etc. Batteries at best lasted half as much compared to Energizer and Duracell. Would not recommend!",0
1,"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low lowered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all of batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them.",0
3,cheap battery power but they don't last well,0
2,"They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does.",0
5,Works just as well as any other batteries just much cheaper!,1
5,"I love the package they came in, it makes it easy to store the extra.",1
1,These batteries leak easily and I found them hard to insert into a toy that required AAA. Did not have this problem when I switched them with brand name batteries.,0
5,"Heap, long lasting batteries. An't beat it.",1
5,I bought these after discovering they were cheaper than any other brand I could buy in the store. I realized after several weeks that we were replacing batteries significantly less often after getting these.,1
5,I'm very happy with these batteries. Cheaper than a local deal at a hardware store. They seem to work as well as the name bands. I'm happy with the quality and quantity.,1
5,Good baths,1
2,"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basis battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand",0
5,These were purchased to add to our many battery operated Christmas decorations. They continue to perform as advertised.,1
3,"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store",0
5,To far these batteries perform as well as any other alkaline battery that I have used. The cost even beats Duracell at Osteo so I consider it a good deal.,1
3,Not really the greatest,0
5,Amazon Basis. That's all that needs to be said:),1
1,These batteries are cap. Last a few days in box controller. Energizer lasts months. On't waste your money.,0
1,"These are the worst batteries i have ever bought. Two days in my remote for to and replaced and 2 days later,dead. Am very disappointed with you Amazon for selling this to me.",0
5,"Love this when I'm doing my make. it was a lot larger than I expected which I really loved! The only con I found is that it is TOO BRIGHT. When I first used it, my eyes and head hurt because of the brightness. But overall, this is a great product.",1
1,Must put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.,0
2,These batteries die quickly!,0
1,"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that most the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energies lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energies lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last six as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window.",0
3,Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.,0
3,They die pretty quick in certain items. But decent price. Vice packing though. I'd probably buy again just for remote smaller items.,0
1,Defective and cheap. Only a third held any charge and those died super fast.,0
1,"He must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. To much for 10 year shelf life.",0
1,"I put two of these batteries in my tireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I'll never get my money back. I'll just write it off as a lesson learned.",0
5,"AAA batteries. They make things go. I, up...I have nothing else. I mean, batteries are pretty much--Oh, wait! They're quite shiny also.",1
5,Great deal!! Ve had no problems with these batteries.,1
1,"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. .",0
1,DID NOT RECIEVE of I only received Batteries!,0
3,"Ordered on accident when I had searched for RECHARGEABLE batteries. Not happy. I will be less free about ordering on Amazon from now on. By fault, but it made my put up my guard.",0
1,"I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand.",0
2,died quick,0
1,these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my of thermostat which is battery lowered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energies - they last for at least a few most. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.,0
1,these batteries died very quickly when compared to energies or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.,0
1,"the last time i had batteries go dead so soon were the ones i purchased at harbor freight.. i had to change the batteries in a coast remote every 2 weeks and in my digital camera , without the flash after 20 shots..",0
1,Heap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Man brand again.,0
2,Disappointed by the amount of time these batteries lasted.,0
1,Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it,0
1,On't bother. The of's I bought got remote last a third as long as everready batteries.,0
1,"Worked for one day, then stopped working. An't tell if it deterred any cats because it only went off when I walked by, but didn't register the cats when they jumped on the counter.Would not recommend.",0
2,These things do not last very long either in the product they are lowering or on the shelf. The ones we had on our shelf were not even good to use after 4 months of sitting.,0
3,"Additional into now a couple of months later... He were very disappointed in these batteries as they did not last long at all. He put one in a regular kitchen clock and within 1 week, the time was off by 20 minutes. But them in a different clock, same results, time was off by 10 minutes within a few days, put them in a battery op shaven, which the other bands most of the time last at least a month, these lasted about a week. Even a small weather station about a week until the time was wrong. Not the 20 pack, not sure if it was a bad batch but we do not recommend these batteries and wont buy them again. Tore bands and Rayovac last much longer. Original review below, still stands as easy opening but did edit to say how disappointed we are.Amazon basis of batteries EASY OPEN packing is FABULOUS, no cut fingers on sharp plastic packing and no need for scissors, opened like a dream.... GREAT IDEA!!! Haven't had them long enough to see how long lasting they are.",0
2,These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore. The Energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing. I will be using far more batteries so it really isn't a money save. Disappointed!,0
1,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Had, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. When I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. Of I was home, I would have used my battery peter. To 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fan, but not this time.",0
5,Ought several times and they last,1
3,Medium disability. Donna buy Duracell in future. To you have great quality rechargeables,0
5,"Because paying 20-40 dollars at Palmar (depending on type) for the same thing makes sense right Of you are like me and have 3 kiss that all have annoying gizmos and electronic cap that takes batteries it is hard to beat Amazon's bulk batteries.These seem to have the same general capacity of a standard Energizer. I have not tested these with my would thief to see how long they can last. But I'd say on par with the others.His may sound work-- when batteries are this cheap, you will find yourself putting them back into toys, remote, electronics that you had previously marked as not necessary to be lowered.",1
1,DOA. Had to replace with other batteries. That a disappointment. Threw them away. :(,0
1,I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.,0
2,"I've bought a lot of AmazonBasics batteries, and nearly all of them have been more than half dead on arrival. By remote controls won't even work with the brand new batteries in place. I won't be buying these again.",0
3,They are ok batteries. I use them on my remote and have to switch out frequently.,0
5,good price good batteries,1
5,These are batteries so what can one say. ...they are economical and function. I bought light motion that require 3 AAA batteries. I needed 9 and they all work fearlessly. Plus now my remote control also works too.,1
2,It doesn't work with my Amazon tireless mouse,0
1,"On't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my tireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results.",0
1,"These straight up don't work. I have put 6 different, brand new batteries from this pack into a controller and none of them have worked. Steer clear.",0
5,Why spend more on other brand name batteries when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they work really well.,1
5,"On't know why I waited so long to finally invest in rechargeable batteries. Once you switch, you won't go back!",1
3,These are prices nice but don't last long,0
1,Great deal price wise but don't seem to last very long at all. To really not a good deal at all. Would not buy again.,0
3,I like that these batteries are cheaper but they don't last as long as I'd like. He will continue to buy them though because of the price.,0
1,"His is my and time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely package, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train.",0
1,I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.,0
3,"On't last quite as long, but DAMN, you can buy three times as many as leading batteries. For our office staff, very worth it.",0
3,"I didn't expect them to be as good as duracell or energies, but they only lasted a few weeks in my clock.",0
1,These batteries don't last half as long as the RayoVacs I usually get.,0
5,The price point is what attracted me to these of batteries. They last as long or longer than most other bands. He have several outdoor christmas decorations that use these and they performed great. AmazonBasics batteries are the best.,1
1,"Disappointed... In my handed Microsoft tireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Crime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON'T PUT THESE of ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detector, emergency flashlights and radius.",0
5,On't see any difference between energies or duracell and a fraction of the cost. To Amazon!,1
5,"Great value for batteries in bulk - our household expends batteries quickly, so it's great to always have a back supply.The low cost of these means I can afford to keep plenty on hand. The quality is comparable to most other bands we've tried - especially for video game controller and the like.",1
1,"These batteries are supposed to be 1.5 vols. But I opened and tried to use them as soon as I got them and had problems.I checked the batteries and they only had 1.25 vols upon delivery and of course they are non returnable.On't waste your money on these, go ahead and pay a little more and get the popular name bands.",0
2,"On't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detector with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detector. On't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product.",0
1,"Awful. Ought these specifically for my very small milk brother, these batteries can barely power the thing! I used whatever name brand in the brother before this and it ran full blast. But with the Amazon batteries, it gets up to like medium speed and doesn't even last 1/2 as long. Will never buy Amazon batteries again.",0
1,"Very, very, very difficult to turn on and off, not sticky enough and kept falling down, complete waste of money.When I could get them on and they were sticking, the lighting effect was very nice however, the quality of the product was zero.",0
2,The original Amazon Basis in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use.,0
3,"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to charge them and it leaned all over my battery charge. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. To if I were you, don't charge them",0
1,Worst battery I have ever came across. On't use for children's toys leads battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaned battery acid all over.,0
1,"Ought a, c d iv batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope iv work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't worked c batteries they lasted 12 of a of Amazon batteries are horrible",0
5,"Exactly what I needed, lots of of batteries for a cheap price. They last just as long as any other battery so this was totally worth it. Will only buy my batteries from here now on.",1
2,"I've used these batteries in several devices now, and they always run out of juice much faster than typical of batteries.",0
1,I've only found 2 out of the box that have lasted longer than a week!,0
5,Trains Last... Stem just as described....,1
2,Not very long lasting batteries....,0
3,Duracell batteries last longer than these.,0
5,"Considering that Duracell batteries are guaranteed to leak and ruin your device, these are an excellent alternative.",1
5,"Had for about 6 weeks, easy to configure , no issues set , works as advertised.",1
3,Does not last as long as name bands such as Duracell and Energizer.,0
5,"Works great and cheaper than at big box stores! He have lots of shameless candles, so these are great",1
5,These batteries appear to work well. He haven't had any problems. He will buy again and enjoy the savings.,1
3,Their batteries,0
5,"Why people buy batteries at the store any more is beyond me. The price on these can't be beat and they last as long as the name brand batteries. Even better they show up at your door, leaving you do spend time doing things you want to do.",1
5,Very battery had a voltage reading between 1.61 and 1.iv. Will update if the lifespan of these batteries is less than expected.,1
5,"They work really well, and the value is excellent for the price.",1
5,Exactly as described. Using these batteries in one of my remote that seems to eat batteries on a i-monthly basis. Definitely cheaper than buying from big box stores and work just as well.,1

5,"i now use of and AAA amazon batteries, great price, same quality as name bands.",1
5,The price is unbearable! Never buying batteries at CVS again,1
5,These Amazon Basic batteries are just as good as the expensive name brand. I'll be buying these from now on.,1
5,Most bang for the buck for quality long lasting emergency power source. I would highly recommend this product!,1
5,Excellent,1
5,Great price and lasts just as long as leading bands of batteries.,1
5,Great product for its value. Amazon isn't doing things just because Amazon does things because they are needed by customers and this is just small example of that.,1
5,"Super excellent bulk pricking.Batteries are batteries and these work just as good as the big name bands.Have you seen the battery prices lately in retail stores Outrageous. These amazon branded, bulk, prime shipping simply cannot be beat in quality and cost.Stock up! Or not because you get them in a few days Crime shipping, no worries.They come in a nice compact package, and groups of batteries are shrink wrapped together for neat storage.Never buy those big names again! Met these instead!",1
5,These batteries work just as well as named bands but much cheaper. Been using them for years.,1
5,"Throw away all my genetic batteries and replaced with these. 48-Back came in a nice carbon box with 4-pus. battery in each plastic wrap. Used in remote controller, game controller, mouse, automatic spray air freshness, LED flashlights and camping lanterns, clocks, wall lamps, and other devices. Excellent batteries for the price.",1
5,"Excellent batteries, at a good price.",1
5,Love the product and the price.Batteries work great. I love that I can keep extra on hand. Batteries come in either brown sturdy box or plastic box.,1
5,"I needed AAA batteries and it's going to be a while before I get to Osteo to get some. I was buying something else on Amazon and decided to get some batteries, to give it a chance. They arrived in 2 days, they were well package and sealed, and most importantly, they work great, they hold a charge well, I am very pleased. Excellent batteries.",1
5,Fantastic deal on Triple-A batteries. I use a lot of them,1
5,"Vice and fresh, dated 10 years out! I use these in everything, should last a long time.",1
5,"Excellent power and price. You can't beat this deal on high quality batteries. Even the club warehouse prices for their own store bands are more expensive than these.They provide more than adequate power for everything we've used them for.They work very good for small flashlights too.Seriously. You are not going to find a better deal for high quality, reliable alkaline batteries anywhere.",1
5,"Excellent price and they last for a long time. Have not had one leak either, like the other brand I use to use.",1
5,"Excellent price, and they are long-lasting batteries. I have no interest in purchasing batteries from anywhere else from now on.",1
5,"Works as expected, excellent price!",1
5,"Excellent batteries, work well, price is right. Cannot tell difference between these and the name brand.",1
5,These really do last a long time. I have bought them more than once and will again. Definitely recommend.,1
5,"Ought these on a lightning deal....10.50 for 48 x of batteries. He go through batteries regularly even though we have some rechargeable batteries at home. Excellent...well package in a box where they can be stored until needed. Amazon basic batteries last just as long as, if not longer, than other branded batteries and thus they are a staple in our home for both of and AAA sizes.",1
5,Excellent value. Well made batteries.,1
5,"These work just as expected and offer great bang for your buck. They are batteries after-all, there isn't much to them, and they serve only one purpose. These are just as good as more expensive Duracell and Energizer alkaline batteries, but since they are AmazonBasics branded, you're not paying more money for fancier packing and marketing.",1
5,I've put these on our recurring order. They last as long (and in some cases longer) than name brand batteries at a fraction of the cost!,1
5,Great value product!,1
5,"Excellent, no dead batteries so far. Vice to have a big pack, wrapped by 6 so they are not all loose.",1
5,A great deal and great quality! I'm now subscribed to receive these batteries every 6 months.,1

5,These are excellent batteries!,1
2,Good price but batteries don't last long compared to other bands,0
5,"Happy with my purchase of the 48-pack of size of. Is with all batteries, I check the expiration dates before opening. I got these in October 2016, and they will remain excellent up to March 2026. There is no way I can buy these locally at this price unless I go to a Collar Tore and buy already-expired or close-to expiring dates. I need these to replenished my emergency supplies. These came in one box, six sets of four wrapped together. (Edited to correct dates)",1
1,"Went cheap...got cheap. of NOT BUY. Went to pack for an coming trip and noticed brown stuff all over. I was storing the batteries in a separate case (which is now ruined). Thank goodness this wasn't in any if my expensive cuba or camera equipment. Never had other bands do this. Always store batteries outside of equipment anyway. Totally summed. Shame on you Amazon. Met out of the battery business. I buy A LOT on Amazon... ALOT, but no more batteries.",0
5,I will only buy these batteries from now on. Extremely well prices and excellent longevity!,1
1,"The advertisement promises a 4 channel boat. It is not - only one channel. Consequently, kiss can't play simultaneously with more than one boat (which was the reason I bought several). Simple false advertising. The main reason I bought this model over others was that it was promised with multiple channels.",0
5,West buy for batteries! You'd think I'd never run out...and I don't with this great pack! Letter than name brand.... Oh...wait...Amazon Basis is NAME BRAND!! Definitely recommend!,1
1,"These batteries are june. Some of the new once have no more power than the once they replaced. Of they are good, they ware out very quickly. I don't like to make negative reports, but these are so bad!",0
5,these batteries are just ok,1
3,For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem,0
5,For the price you can't beat these. I have never had any issues with them. They last long and work well.,1
2,These are so wasteful!! Rechargeable batteries are so much better!! The Amazon rechargeable ones are awesome!! And you can use and refuse and charge and refuse them again and again and again and AGAIN!!,0
1,They are bad batteries. Not long lasting at all,0
2,On't last very long,0
5,great performance and value,1
5,"Excellent buy for the money. And with a 10 year storage Life Expectancy, you can't beat it.",1
5,"An not complain, they arrived on time, I'm not expecting them to last too long, but I needed batteries for some toys, so.",1
3,Batteries seem like any other they work and seem to last,0
5,Batteries that do their job: turn on my electronics. They last long too. Bargain price.,1
3,"These are good if you're broke and just need to get by. They work, but like other reviews are saying, they don't last as long as other bands or rechargeable batteries. Of you have the money, invest in batteries that last longer and tax the environment less.",0
5,"Long lasting batteries for my deer can, compare to name brand batteries for way less money.",1
3,They're cheap for a reason - they don't last nearly as long as Energizer or Duracell's from what I've noticed.,0
5,Great for all of my sons toys,1
3,"so far they are work well, however have had them long enough to determine if how long they last compared to duracell batteries.",0
5,"Good batteries, seem to be just as good as other named bands.",1
3,"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their Of batteries. The Of batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaned and were stuck together. Taking it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packing for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get.",0
5,Good pick.we will see how long that last..,1
3,Not tested so I'm not sure of quality,0
5,Solid so far. Good price,1
3,These are a great price but they don't seem to last as long as you would expect. Also I have found some are already dead upon arrival.,0
5,Good price. To far batteries seem to be of excellent quality.,1
3,they seem a bit hit-or-miss...had a few kind cap out pretty quickly (way too quickly) on me when used in my young son's toys,0
5,He'll see how long they last over time.,1
3,"Great value for kid's toys, but they don't have the longevity of Duracells by any stretch. Definitely worth buying if you need a lot of batteries for cheap to top off all the noisemakers and remote in your house, but I wouldn't throw them in flashlights or other higher-drain devices.",0
5,"Great for the price. I really recommend this, i got this to light up the ratio with lantern for an event they work all day and all night with no problem i count be happier!",1
2,they dont last as long as the higher end rechargeable do or the regular baths do. I would say about half the time.,0
5,great price,1
3,They are package by is and the plastic is really hard to get off.,0
5,have you ever needed some double A batteries well look no further!,1
2,"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked popularity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) To it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon of with no problems.",0
2,"Unfortunately, some of the batteries seem to be buds. I have replaced dead batteries with these, only to still have a dead remote. Great price, but I now know why...",0
3,Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the of and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.,0
5,That a deal! And finally I will not run out of batteries! That a great idea... a 100 of them!,1
1,"absolute garage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energies, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money any price, except maybe free.",0
3,got it because of reviews. I really can't say they are any better than any other cheaper or more expensive brand. how can you rate it or check it. when your remote stop working you put in new batteries.simple as that.,0
5,I absolutely love Amazon Spring end I never have any complaints they always stand behind their products although it's never needed because their products are normally made very well with quality materials I only buy my batteries off Amazon no I will not pay the price in the store as I find Amazon's batteries last approximately the same as like Energizer or Duracell and thieves Amazon basic brand batteries are probably half that price,1
5,I am a professional photographer and have these as back for flash. kiss steal them for their gazing.. they work and last the same as every name brand.,1
5,I am satisfied the batteries I received are just as good as any other name brand batteries that you could buy.,1
5,"Amazon Basis. I am so glad these are part of the basis. I love these batteries. I get equal or better performance as you might expect from Duracel or Energizer. The benefit is that I pay less. Very single time I walk past batteries in a store I think, Amazon Basis and then like Sector from Despicable He, I can hear, Oh YEAH!",1
2,"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Nothing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again.",0
5,I needed batteries and after having read and seen so many positive reviews I bought my first batch of Amazon Basis batteries. I was an Energizer girl and was very skeptically of trying another brand as other attempts proved unworthy. I am very pleased by the quality endurance of these batteries! I started with AAA and they worked so well that I bought of when I needed more. The price can't be beat either! These batteries serve their purpose well and last a long time - the best bang for the buck that I have found!,1
3,"I bought the batteries because of good reviews. I checked the voltage on several of the batteries, and they were fine. I have not had the batteries in use long enough to comment further.",0
3,The batteries work but not well or for long for anything that requires a lot of power. I bought these for flame-less candles and they are perfect for that. But when I tried to use them in a child's toy they batteries died very quickly.,0
5,GREAT BATTERIES and even Letter PRICE!!!I will definitely order more when I run out.,1
5,You can never go wrong with Expensive batteries that are delivered right to your door and last just as long if not longer than the national bands. From camera to flash lights and toys these batteries last the test of time.,1
3,I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they eminently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.,0
5,"I should be a better citizen of the environment and use rechargeable batteries. I should, but I am not doing that. Instead, I'm buying the disposal ones like it's still 1985. Of you're like me and are lazy and stupid, these will serve you well. Good value, standard batteries, etc etc. They aren't saving the earth or anything, but they are good functional batteries.",1
1,I purchased these batteries because of the price and the backing of Amazon. I figured Amazon wouldn't put their name on a poor product. I used 12 of these batteries in an application and all 12 failed within a few days. Other batteries lasted months. For now I'll stay away from this product and fork out a few more bucks for a battery from a main stream manufacturer.,0
5,"I found these batteries great, shipped on time, as advertised, good expiration dates, well package. I am puzzled by Amazon's refusing to ship more while investing what it claims are reports of problems. The reviews show overwhelmingly positive responses with 5 negative. I see Amazon happily offering many products with far worse states. That is the story here When will the 'investigation' be over (Should the FBI be called in ) )",1
1,These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a years will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed,0
5,"It's a bunch of batteries, I have always had good luck with these batteries, All I know is you put them into the device it works",1
1,"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a time. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work.",0
5,"An not beat the price, since I got them, I started replacing some batteries. It's been several weeks, and I've had no issues with performance, and so far they seem to last just as long as name brand batteries that you would pay the same amount of money for and only get 4 batteries.",1
1,"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Ordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA of with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. On't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC",0
3,I mean..batteries They work.,0
1,"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at at he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. His is a large ty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real summer.",0
5,"I use lots of AAA batteries. I got a lot for the price. I like the neat way they were package. Now long will the last It this price, it doesn't really matter",1
1,"I purchased the of batteries for my West smoke detector. The batteries that came with the West lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon of's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the West indicated that they had to be replaced again. His product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss.",0
5,I put these in some battery lowered candles for a surprise harry porter b day for my girlfriend. He hung the candles from the ceiling. That was three months ago...the candles are still burning!,1
5,"I ran my own longevity test and have the results. I have 4 identical candles, battery operated on a time and sitting on the same table. I wondered myself which battery would last the longest. I put a EverReady battery in one, Rayovac battery, one AmazonBasics battery and one Maxwell battery purchased from amazon.com. They were all purchased within a week of each other (thanks for friends and family that each donate two battery). The batteries were put in each candles at the same time and set the time to 8 hours on each. After 25 days I had my first failure. The Rayovac candle didn't turn on. It day 26 the Maxwell battery failed. and at day 27 the EverReady failed to turn on my candle. Long came day 27 - five hours into the 8 hour set time and the AmazonBasics didn't make my candle work. I know this isn't a 'scientific' test but satisfied me as to which battery I will be buying from now on and those friends and family will now also be buying AmazonBasic Performance Alkaline Batteries.",1
5,"I really like Amazon batteries. I think they work just as well as any of the other bands, but at a much better price point.",1
2,"UPDATE June 2016Batteries do not last long at all. I am using mostly for tireless mouse. 1 battery last approve. 2-3 weeks. In my humble opinion, that is terrible. I retract my previous review.PREVIOUS REVIEW:Fantastic price, wonderful reliable product. I am a tried and true believer and purchaser.",0
1,"His is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a There Tireless Beta 58 mid. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mid. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mid on and by the end of the gig the light on the mid showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full figs out of an alkaline battery. Must as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Owe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basis and last twice as long in my mid.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long.",0
1,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON of WOULD of GOOD. WRONG!!!! of'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS of of COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I of LET DOWN of AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.,0
5,I use batteries for low drain electronics like hand held GPS. Rested these against Duracell copper tops and was surprised that the Amazon Basis last longer than Duracell. 24 hours vs 21. Not a huge difference but they are 1/2 the price:),1
5,Really high value batteries. I use them for my tireless mouse and they works fine.,1
5,"Heap AAA batteries! Haven't had any issue with them so far, I use them in stuff like... my nose hair trimmed.",1
1,These batteries were expired dead when they arrived at my house. I was very disappointed.,0
5,"pleasantly surprised, i was worried they would run out quickly but they work great",1
2,DID NOT LAST LONG,0
5,i won't buy batteries from home depot etc. anymore because these are equal quality to the well known bands and they are much cheaper and don't require sawing through plastic to open.,1
3,I miss the funny with the drum.,0
1,I'm a huge fan of amazon so I figured I'd give these a shot. These have no life whatsoever. Even something as low-power as to remote they only last about 2 weeks tops.Spend the extra money and go with name brand.,0
5,Why spend money on overpriced batteries when you can get AmazonBasics! These batteries work great and are package so neatly for storage. I highly recommend ordering these.,1
5,"I'm getting better results from these batteries than I do from the name brand. Of the truth be known, they are probably made by one of the name bands.",1
2,I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packing.,0
5,"His is the way to buy batteries, especially if you have Crime. Were's how my thinking goes: Running short on batteries To to Amazon and order these again. It's Basis.",1
2,"Wont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other genetic batteries.",0
5,I only buy my batteries from Amazon. They are expensive and last a long time! Super impressed with their quality of batteries.,1
3,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkaline here on Amazon.-- For camera and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Were's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. Is a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in camera or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Nina tested these AmazonBasics of's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (may), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital camera, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.To, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basis are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Funny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (may). In the other hand, they hold up better in camera and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. To, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Osteo Ireland Signature. Battery Nina's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Osteo batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Osteo member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value.",0
5,received quickly with n o damages. His battery seems to be the same as all the other ones.,1
3,"I mean, it's a cap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly.",0
5,Pretty good batteries and arrived early for my gazing mouse.,1
1,You get what you pay for. They do not last very long at all. It's better to buy Duracell.,0
5,Its a very good and compact packing.the batteries work awesome.I recommend it and would definitely buy them again,1
3,Its of. Not much life in the batteries.,0
3,These batteries are just a tiny bit too short to work in every AAA device. Beware.,0
5,Must as expected. He used them for the later tag guns and they guns are still going strong after two weeks of constant use.,1
5,"Must as good as leading bands, but clot cheaper. Will be buying more in the future.",1
1,Maybe I received a defective batch but these are so bad.To longevity at all. Used up within 2 weeks whereas the branded ones last 2 months!I will not purchase them again regardless of the lower cost.,0
5,"A nice size bulk pack of AAA batteries. Seats the prices of what palmar or target has. These are NOT rechargeable, seen some people asking if they were in the question box. Will do just fine for remote, flash lights, kiss toys etc.",1
2,You know these are just ok. They done last as long as the Copper top battery.,0
2,"On't seem to last as long as other batteries, you get what you pay for.",0
5,Great quality and super cheap! That else you can ask for,1
5,Met my expectations for Alkaline AAA. I would recommend these to a friend.,1
1,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just peeped and didn't clock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that of batteries aren't all created equal.",0
5,"These have worked really well. I've had these batteries for a few months, and I don't think any of the items that I have used that required batteries have died yet. Hoping the batteries continue to work for awhile longer. It is really nice have a large supply of batteries especially since these last so long!",1
1,"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaned all over the compartment.Must NOW, while tying on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the neck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again.",0
1,Very single battery leaned battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was lowering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charge once they were fully charged. His happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaned battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an box 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an safe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacement for the devices they ruined.,0
1,"Ought these March 2015. It's now Web 2017 and my son said his toy lightsaber had just stopped working. Opened it up and batteries have leaned causing corrosive to contact. To longer works, even with new batteries. It's not a very expensive toy, but the 1 most important aspect of a battery is that it not leak. That's the point of saving a few dollars on batteries if they are going to ruin something much more expensiveWith major bands, you can send in leaned batteries and device for repair or refund. Although I've never done thisThe version I bought were silver and green, so perhaps they have changed.Peaked batteries had 1.46,1.46,1.iv respectively.",0
2,"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Tom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. Is he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddles they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/disability.",0
1,"I like these batteries, but a couple of times now after putting them in I have opened up the compartments to find battery acid leaking out inside, I figured it was just a one off, but it has now happened several times, I am reluctant to use them anymore in case I damage items",0
5,"These batteries don't seem inferior to the more expensive Duracells and Energizer that we have been using. He have been using these primarily to go in our box One controller, and they last a few weeks to a month with pretty consistent use, about the same as other was we have used. The price can't be beat, even cheaper than Osteo at the time of purchase and with free shipping in haste free packing.",1
3,"Fro: Relatively expensive, although I did end up waiting almost two weeks for delivery.Sons: High drop-out rate. They come in packs of four when used in Tikhon camera it's not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to 1.48V while the fourth has dropped to...1.Of. They come out of the box within a hundredth of a vol of each other, so I'm guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or there's a interesting failure mode under load.",0
3,"Yes life short, that's right",0
5,Life span long...performance unto satisfaction. Reliable. To failure. Only performance.,1
5,"I will never need to buy batteries again. These are great , what I love is that they're not loose , they come together in packs of four.",1
1,I ordered these thinking they were rechargeable (I recognize the error on my part but that is not my complaint here) .. so when I received them and used them I was not surprised that they died VERY quickly. Upon attempting to charge these I figured out they aren't rechargeable (Once again big due on my part)..Now I'm seriously surprised that I'm only getting a few hours of use out of them!! like a quarter of the use that a typical battery should offer. Horribly disappointed.. I will go back to the name brand batteries for sure.,0
5,Really liked the batteries - seem to hold up well and keep a decent charge,1
5,These batteries seem to work as well as other bands at a much better price point.,1
3,"Good knob. Looks good. Go faded/wore off in a few months though... log is kind why I bought this, so..........",0
5,"Incredible deal for this prices, the batteries are long duration nice!",1
5,Excellent Batteries,1
5,These batteries seem to last as long as the name bands you would purchase at the store. I have saved a lot of money by buying these in bulk instead of running to the store every time I need batteries. I am happy with these and will probably order more when I run out.,1
5,"THESE BATTERIES WORK JUST of GOOD of THE BRANDS YOU ALREADY KNOW, BUT of NOT COST NEARLY of MUCH MONEY. THATS A WINNER FOR of.",1
2,"Been using Amazon of and AAA batteries over the past 6 months in a variety of electronic items and have found that they do not last as long as higher quality, higher price batteries. I guess you get what you pay for!",0
5,These batteries perform just as well as the big name bands and for a fraction of the cost.,1
2,"I am extremely disappointed with these batteries, which stems not from longevity or power, but with fit. Almost immediately upon receiving them I installed them into three electric candles. To joy. I cleaned the contact, still no joy. I tested the batteries, full charge. Must for gains, I installed into one candle three May-O-Sac brand batteries, and the candle lit with no problem. Removed the May-O-Sacs, installed the Masons, and again, no joy. I repeated this a couple of times with the same results. And I tried this in the other two candles with identical results: All three candles lit with the May-O-Sacs, none with the Masons. Knowing the issue was not with candles, I took a May-O-Sac and lined it up with an Amazon, and discovered something interesting: the batteries were just a wee bit different.The length of the positive terminals are different, just a had longer on the May-O-Sac (see picture). The May-O-Sac terminal is taller (longer) while the Amazon terminal is squat-tier and therefore shorter. The difference in length is tiny, no question: but when you're putting batteries into a rather cheap device to start with, that tiny bit of length in this case seems to be the difference between one battery forming a sufficient connection and the other one not. I'll keep the Masons to use in devices (mice, for example) that are likely more solid built than these candles and have a greater connection tolerable (or a stronger spring) to hold the battery firmly in place. I am concluding that when replacing batteries in an older device (that may not force as firm a connection) or in a cheap device that may not hold batteries tightly from the get-go, use a branded-name battery.I am a longtime and extremely satisfied user of Amazon Basic computer tables (among their first products in the Basis line), but was recently disappointed with another item I purchased outside of the computer connections and tables line (that being dog house-training middle pads, which have not prove as absorbent as similarly-prices products, and I've bought a lot of different bands). The batteries were my second forty into Basis product lines outside of the oh-so-dependable-tables arena, and now I'm 2 for 2 in the disappointed column. I never thought there was a difference in batteries, and now I know differently. The next time I see a Duracell commercial emphasizing reliability and dependability, I'll think back to this experience, as I will when selecting batteries in the future. I so wanted to like these Amazon batteries, too.",0
5,I use these in my Bluetooth gazing chair's transmitted that uses 2 AAA's. Approximate battery life is 50+ hours. Incredible!,1
1,"May have been a luke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and tireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries.",0
2,I bought them to go into a flashlight. They never lasted more that a few hours and got really dim. maybe good for things like remote controls,0
2,"Lasted one month in my carbon monoxide detector. Maybe these are good for other applications, but disappointed with their performance.",0
5,"An't beat the price for all these batteries. Why would people go to local store and pay exorbitant prices for batteries which you can get at a cheaper price. Maybe they last as long say for instance like Duracell or Eveready but for the price of an off brand, it is still well worth it.",1
3,These are decent cheap batteries but they don't last as long as Eveready Or Duracell or Rayovac. they really are only good enough for remote and the like. I don't like to use them in anything else.,0
2,Summed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicked or something that isn't used often but we used these for Box one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.,0
3,"These do not last nearly as long as a name brand battery. To considering the cost/benefit, i'm not really sure if they are any better",0
2,They don't last as long as other batteries. The Rayovacs that I get from Owes are way better.,0
5,Great bang for the buck. Amazon batteries....Who knew,1
5,"I'm a self proclaimed bargain shipper. But at the same time I want a quality product. I make a point of reading reviews to make sure that there are some satisfied customers before I take a chance on a product. I'm happy to say that these batteries were a good choice. I have grandkids that love to play video games using remote that use 4 batteries per controller. They go through these things like crazy. To, finding some that were unfordable was necessary to keep everyone happy.",1
5,"I can never have enough batteries. He use them so quickly, I love to have extra boxes. These were a good price and they seem to work well.",1
5,Great deal on these! Seem to have more initial power than most alkaline. Great for my electric razor! Met them if you have kiss with lots of toys that eat batteries!,1
5,"Great, but would like higher rating rechargeables.",1
5,Worked well. I got these for some remote control mice I had purchased. Such fun was had sharing the office staff.,1
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far.",0
5,I have these on the subscribe and save listener had any issues with old batteries or out-of-dateevery order has been perfect.By only small grip is they seem do not last very long.But value wise they still beat buying name bands.D. (Indiana An),1
1,But together mobile but it refuses to turn. Mind of painless. Next time would spend a few more dollars and get something more sturdy and reliable.,0
5,good batteries,1
3,"Ought these on Amazon for a good price, but they just don't seem to last very long. The packing and batteries look nice. One of them leaned, but that could be because I went through them so fast.",0
5,Heap Batteries! Vice!,1
1,I wanted solar batteries.,0
3,Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.,0
5,But 18 of the batteries in devices already and they all work. Last delivery no issues,1
5,They last as long as Rayovac batteries.,1
2,These batteries do not last long. I put some in a portable can opened and was able to open about 10 can.,0
5,Good Real for the price,1
1,"They were buds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Hope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas.",0
1,"3/4 of the package have been buds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. His defeats that purpose.",0
3,"There ok, not as good as I would of liked for what I need them for. I would purchase again.Last , good delivery.",0
3,"I bought 20 and I used 9 in three Motorola Walkabouts radius.One the second use, after only two hours use on first, a battery failed. I was shocked at this. It made my Walkabout useless for the child-safety reason I bought it.Now I cannot trust the rest and I will use then in unimportant places like toys.",0
3,Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.,0
1,These batteries did not even last a day with some LED lights we used. I do not recommend these to anyone. To with a good brand name.,0
1,These batteries leaned into my mouse and killed it. Not cool Amazon.,0
2,Certainly not as good as Duracell. Some are very good........ others go bad in as little as two weeks. I put 3 in a plugged-in weather radio to serve as battery back up. Not a message that batteries needed replacing after only 2 weeks. A battery tested confirmed that they should be replaced. I guess I will go back to the Duracells.,0
2,"Ought these for my digital camera based on a semi-professional review. Each set of 2 lasted less than an hour in my camera. Have used other bands of regular of batteries and they have lasted much longer. Of it's camera you're buying them for, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",0
5,"Great battery, great price. NOT frustration-free though. Each row of 4 batteries was wrapped up so you had to open 12 packs individually.",1
1,These worked for about a week. When started leaking and just stopped working. I ended up throwing them away. I even had to throw a string of lights out because of the leads of batteries.,0
2,"eh...they run out of charge very quickly....its honestly bad for the environment. they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than these..update 1: these batteries pack's have 50 working(short term) and 50 non-working batteries...I brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that don't work.In my estimation, i think these batteries are not worth it.",0
2,Good Value but they dont last very long,0
1,I will not purchase these again. They last about 1/2 the life of the Duracell ones.,0
2,"These are not comparable to Duracell. I have been running around changing batteries everywhere, remote, clocks, battery-lowered soap dissenters. All the dying batteries are the lame Amazon basis. Ought duracells at Osteo. They probably last twice as long. I bought these to get free shipping on orders over 35. On't do the same. It's not worth it. Very disappointing.",0
5,Great price for batteries and they work!,1
2,I thought from the reviews that I had found a really good battery for less money than I usually paid for DuraCell but I was wrong. I put these in a my battery operated Halloween decorations and they lasted exactly 3 weeks on a 4 hour time mode. The tompkins where I used DuraCell are still glowing brightly. Guess it's back to the other brand for my battery operated Christmas decorations.,0
2,These batteries don't seem to last quite as long as regular brand name.,0
3,Totally not convinced these are as good as name bands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.,0
1,Not suitable for toys. Trained within just a couple of days.,0
5,I use these all the time. They have come in handy for a few remote that we have gotten and only used these sized batteries. They last a decent amount of time. Not the greatest but also for the size they work well.,1
3,"Definitely not Duracell, but it gets the job done. Last for a while, but died sooner than expected.",0
2,"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before.",0
2,Not happy with quality. To not last very long in various devices.By guess is that william hour rating are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.,0
2,"About the same as May O Sac, not very good.",0
2,These batteries were horrible. They died with a couple of days use. I figured since they were Amazon brand they would be good but I was mistaken. Sorry I would not recommend these to anybody.,0
1,Not worth a cap don't waist your money. I purchased these for under cabinet lighting and they hardly have enough power. The light is way more dim than other batteries.,0
1,"His batteries didn't last very long in anything we used them in (clock, toy, flashlights). Would not buy them again.",0
2,They simply do not last very long. Not worth the money.,0
3,"These batteries are only of. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginal shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Collar Tore batteries.)",0
3,Must ok,0
5,"In a world where of Alkaline Batteries are essentially obsolete, these batteries by AmazonBasics get the job done. I used these for a Logitech tireless mouse and they have worked fine. Overall, I would recommend these batteries to anyone looking for both performance and value.",1
1,"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac.",0
5,Must batteries. Nothing special or bad about them.,1
5,Obviously they are excellent batteries where you can get them in a very nice small package so it is not taking up much room. The batteries themselves work as well or better than other bands that I have purchased. I only purchase AmazonBasics Alkaline Batteries for all the sizes that we need.,1
5,These perform as well as your typical name brand batteries at a lesser price. I'll continue to buy these in lieu of the more expensive ones.,1
5,Long lasting cheap batteries what more do you went,1
5,good deal,1
3,Now do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!,0
3,not what I was looking for but they are ok.,0
5,ok,1
3,Pretty good but the batteries do get used up fairly quickly. I use them for tireless miss and they last for maybe 5 or 6 hours TOPS. I need to compare them with Duracell to really get an idea of their quality.,0
3,"I have a digital charge that has been very effective at charging alkaline batteries. I usually get two or three 90 charges from a quality battery before it starts to leak. These are fine for their original life, but none could handle a charge. Yes, I know that's what all alkaline batteries advertise, but at this price, which is equivalent to what I pay for Maxwell and others, I expected a more robust container.",0
1,Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.,0
3,"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a to remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are of.",0
3,"I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energies and was looking for an economical equivalent. His isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your to remote or battery lowered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on.",0
3,The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.,0

5,I only buy batteries from Amazon. Love the Duracell Procell deals but the Amazon branded batteries seem just as good. To way can I score these deals locally.,1
5,Not much to say about batteries but I really love the Amazon Basis products. Great price and same performance as Duracell or similar popular bands.,1
5,That can I say here. These batteries are fantastic. I'll never pay for brand name batteries again. His is the only way to go!!!,1
1,To not leave these batteries sitting on a dresser... or pretty much anywhere you don't want battery acid leaned onto. He took the batteries out of our remote at night and woke up to our brand new 3500 dresser ruined. Awesome.,0
1,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.,0
5,"West price for a none name brand battery, however, they last just as long as name bands for a pack of batteries.",1
1,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.,0
5,"Great price, long lasting and got to my home very fast!",1
5,"Great batteries for an outstanding price! Order here, not through your local store - you'll regret it! It's nothing better than having a drawer full of batteries, too, for those last-minute needs!",1
1,There were 2 batteries missing from the pack. Must annoying enough to write a bad review. Not annoying enough to do anything else about it...,0
2,His pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. His may work for some people but not me.,0

5,"Perfect for our emergency survival basement pantry. I haven't opened the box, and just sealed them in plastic.",1
5,"Excellent value. These come package in little sleeves of four in a large cardboard box. Amazon Basis batteries have always been good performer. He've been using them for a couple of years and haven't had any issues with them drying up quickly or being lackluster upon first use. Vice quality, great deal.",1
5,You can trust Amazon to bring you great products at great price,1
5,To far batteries are good,1
5,Any parent of tollers knows that there are numerous toys that require AAA batteries. He have these always on hand and this price is too good to not stock up. By son even loves sitting down and watching the whole Changing batteries process. Thanks for keeping these so unfordable!,1

5,"Is a mummy to 2 little ones, we go through a lot of batteries around here. Boys require batteries. The baby's vibrating music player requires batteries. And heaven forbid that the baby's music player runs out of batteries!I bought these batteries after reading the good reviews. I'm very impressed that these seem to perform just as well as the Duracell batteries that I normally buy. I haven't noticed any difference in performance or duration. And AmazonBasics are about half the price of the Duracell batteries. Thank you for helping me save money, AmazonBasics!",1
5,Great batteries at a great price,1
5,"Want beat it.. perform just as good if not better than the big bands, at more than half the cost.. Life span is awesome thus far.. ill never buy from the big guns again.",1

5,I did a simple test with 2 identical valueless candles that run on 2 was. Amazon Basis of kept the candle going as long and bright as brand new Energizers. Pretty dark good deal!!,1
5,Great cheap batteries. To more over paying for them!,1
5,"Good price, time will tell on disability",1

5,To far so good testing fully charged,1
5,Quality batteries.,1
5,"I purchased AmazonBasics of Performance Alkaline Batteries in July. It has now been two and a half months since I have been using them. They are definitely comparable to the leading bands out there. They are also much more unfordable. He have used them in everyday items that need batteries. He mainly use them in our remote controls. Before, it always felt like we were replacing our batteries constantly or hunting for batteries. It was nice to buy this pack to have them readily available and also have the option to purchase recurring delivery if we need them...which is something I will definitely consider because of the convenience. I just need to figure out now how often I need them. His pack has lasted awhile.",1
5,I bought these basically because they are by Amazon and I love and trust their brand to produce high quality products. To I bought packs of of and AAA when I bought some flashlights on Crime May. They seem to work great and I expect they will last a long time.,1
5,Easy to open and store . . . equivalent battery life with more expensive bands!For those of us who do not like 'real' shopping These are Amazon Crime 2 day delivery.,1
5,Unbearable price for the amount you get. Quality batteries.,1
5,Great batteries. Work and last like brand name batteries,1
5,"Super buy alkaline of batteries, Checked the 1.5 vols rating and actually read 1.61 vols which indicates its good and new. I was satisfied with my purchase and its very low price compared to other bands of same batteries. I used 4 and works as intended.",1
5,Work as good as any name brand batteries and a great deal. Not much else to say.,1
5,To be honest...these batteries outperformed a big name brand. Period.,1
5,Great deal for our office's most popular battery.,1
5,Glad I ordered this many. I had no idea I'd use nearly half the box as soon as I opened it. Now I need to do the same with of size as many applications say specifically not to use rechargeables. Believe them! I tried it once before and pretty much melted down the item and destroyed the batteries as well. Apparently they are not made to supply as much current and they will let out the (magic) smoke. These came in quickly and are just what I needed,1
5,I saw reviews for batteries on the news and these were rate among best. I'm so glad I can get these from Amazon in bulk for a great price.,1
5,"Hope the feedback, review and pictures I post here will help a few fellow Amazon shippers:Quality 10/10 Breaking Amazon man! Never letting us down. They're build solid and come in a safe and secure packing. Also work great too.Price 9/10 Price isn't dirt-cheap but it's not expensive either. I've seen worst at the local stores or gas stations. AmazonBasics has good deals.Check out the pictures I unloaded here as well.Met me know if you have any questions / if my review, feedback and pictures helped you shop!",1
1,These last about 5 his in a rou remote using the headphones. Really disappointed in how long they last.,0
5,West battery deal ever. Lasts a long time,1
5,These are a great price based on others I've seen. They additional have a very good life cycle based on individual price point as compared to more expensive bands.,1
1,Both packs were useless. Confirmed low charge with multimeter.,0
5,They seem to work well and with a 10 year shelf life why buy in two and 4 packs when you can save money like this.,1
5,"Work very well, lots of power.",1
5,Good price on batteries with good life. Works as long as other name bands. recommended,1
5,"Great price for many batteries. I will now buy their of's. Hated great by of, and all work fine so far and all test fine. Recommended.",1
5,Great value and lightning fast delivery!,1
5,"Product works as advertised, no issues. Recommended.",1
5,"When I heard one of the consumer guns on the radio a few years ago saying that some of the genetic or lesser known bands of batteries were often as good as the name bands, I tried a pack of the AmazonBasics of alkaline batteries instead of the usual name brand. I've bought several packs since then, and although I haven't done any objective testing, they appear to be about as long-lasting and reliable as any other bands that I've tried. Some of the batteries were installed a couple of years ago, and they still have some charge, and there's been no leakage or corrosive. I've been very pleased with the AmazonBasics alkaline batteries.",1
5,"Quality and battery life is the same as name brand. Reminds me of the days when you could go to Radio Hack and get some good, expensive batteries. To far, I haven't had an AmazonBasics products I haven't liked.",1
5,Long lasting product good bang for your buck.,1
5,"Batteries that work that are cheap! Room, sold. Buy them now AND NEVER LOOK BACK.",1
1,These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same...,0
1,"Given its price, probably makes sense but doesn't last very long even with lower power usage or lesser used devices. I'd spend few dollars more and buy Duracell pack from Osteo.",0
5,"These batteries are safe for children, because it features an anti-leakage style. Plus, it's co-friendly so it's not just good for your child, buy also in your surrounding.",1
5,"I love the concept of Amazon basis. I look forward to the savings that can be passed to consumers (hopefully) by stripping out a lot of the non-sense associated with consumer products (marketing, packing, etc.) I see no difference between these and brand name batteries other than the cheaper prices.",1
5,"Perfectly suitable alternative to the overpriced Duracell and Energizer batteries. I didn't notice any difference in performance, and I will never buy the expensive bands again after finding Amazon Basis!",1
5,"To far they're holding up just like the brand name versions, but they're much cheaper.",1
5,These seem to be performing well so far. I've already gone through half. I haven't done any special tests to compare them to more name brand batteries but so far I've not had any issues. By daughter drained one of her video games in about the same time as she does with some of the other bands - but I didn't time it or anything. All of them were there - came nicely package and I like the price. I will most likely continue to buy these batteries now for the convenience and lower price.,1
5,"Heap, works, better quality then duracel.",1
5,"These batteries work as long, if not longer, than the big name batteries. I love them! I swear by them in my remote for my of, sound system, You-May player, rico, and You!",1
5,"I love the money Amazon brand saves us, these batteries work and last just as well as name brand!",1
5,These are excellent batteries and the price is right.,1
2,"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came package nicely. To visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic.",0
1,Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.,0
3,"I'm not entirely pleased with Amazon's batteries. It seems to me that these have been dying faster than the bulk pack I got at Osteo long back (which lasted a long time!). I don't think I'll get these again, I'm returning to the name bands at Costoco once these are used up (and they are getting used up at a rapid pace).",0
5,"Seem to work as well as the big bands at half the cost, no trainer buy. I'm about to get the AAA batteries.",1
5,"seems just as good as higher-prices batteries. I have had good experience with an AmazonBasics tireless mouse I've been using for 1 1/2 years, and the reviews for these batteries are excellent. For the price, I am fully satisfied.",1
5,"expiration of 2026, about 9 years in advance of when I received these.Batteries are shrink wrapped in groups of 5 which is good to provide for protection from discharge after part of the package is opened.",1
5,"I ordered a 20 pack of of batteries from amazon when they were on sale. Seems like my kiss are going through batteries like crazy with their gazing controller and such. By household ends up going through of batteries like there is no tomorrow! To when i saw these were on sale, i had to order some. I decided to hide these ones from the kiss, so i could see if they were comparable to the store bought batteries that seem to always die on us rather quickly. To far my husband has had a set of these batteries in his box controller for days now and they are still going strong. Same with the iii controller- which has a battery indicator even, still says full battery. To far, i am very happy with these batteries and plan to purchase more in the future!",1
3,Seems to be a good product. not sure they have a very long life.,0
3,One of my 48 batteries arrived with what looks like a leak. The rest look fine so I'll just keep them. Otherwise these batteries work just fine.,0
1,"Sign products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. But of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with.",0
1,short battery life,0
1,"Lasted for barely any time at all. I have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but I can fattest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the Amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands. I'm always willing to give Amazon products a try, but these batteries left a lot to be desired.",0
2,These batteries do not have a long life.,0
3,They really don't last very long,0
1,Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name bands last six months. On't waste your money.,0
1,"He have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. But them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. On't waste your money, Buy Duracell instead.",0
1,"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Box One controller. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 of.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name bands, I tried these genetic ones and regret it.",0
2,"To at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term.",0
1,"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxwell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Ah Humbug to Amazon on this one.",0
1,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Sexless Deadbolt (http://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/up/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 of batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in An Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tested (http://www.amazon.com/up/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (http://www.amazon.com/Penis-HL23-Headlamp-of-Of-FENIX-HL23-of-Of-GOLD/up/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die.",0

3,"I like these shoes but Ultra needs to pay more attention to seizing. I normally wear of 7.5-8. The first pair of Superior 2.is I ordered was size 8 and they were way too short. of, I thought, they run short. I ordered a pair size 8.5 and they were just barely long enough.I ordered a second pair size 8.5 and they are visibly half an inch shorter than the first size 8.5 pair. That isn't running short, it's lack of quality control.I really like these shoes, so I am ordering size 9's. But I do not have any warm feelings about Ultra.",0
5,The package is A LOT smaller than I thought. That'since.,1
5,To far so good,1
5,To far so good. Will update if anything changes.,1
5,To far so Good !,1
5,In updated review past my initial use of these will be forthcoming. To far so good.,1
5,To issues thus far. I just started using them so I speak for their longevity.,1
5,They work. To far so good.,1
5,"To far so good. Great value. Well package, nice clean design and arrived quickly.",1
5,To far so good. The batteries are working great. I do like how they are package in groups of 4 inside a box. It keeps them in order once you remove a bundle or two.,1
5,"Ought for camping batteries, so far so good. .. we'll see if there are any issues after storing for a few months. Amazing price.",1
5,To far so good...good value overall time will tell how long they will last but will update if they don't last as long as name bands,1

5,I don't think I can find cheaper Alkaline batteries to be honest. Their life is pretty good too.,1
5,It is the first time I purchased Amazon Basic of Alkaline batteries and I am glad I did. It is a solid performer at reasonable price.. Will buy more in the future for sure!,1
5,"Sleek design. Comes with batteries needed. I've compared the number to another scale that same day hours later and it displayed the same number. I'd say it's very accurate. Clear display, thin black platform. Your typical scale. I did receive this at a dismounted rate for my honest opinion. I'd buy again and would recommend to a friend. Solid product.",1
2,Some batteries worked okay. I just had a problem where a new battery worked for a week and then there was no charge. Not worth the price.,0
2,"For the price and quantity I was sure this would be a great buy. Badly, not all of the batteries worked. I first thought the camcorder we purchased was defective but when I snapped out the fresh, new batteries for a second round of fresh, new batteries from the same package the device magically came to life. Too to you Amazon for selling batteries that don't actually work.",0
5,Exceptional batteries for the price. Must as good if not betterthan major bands. Sometimes you just pay extra for the brand. That is a waste of money.Quality can be found at a reasonable price like these batteries. Duracell and other bands are asking you today for there brand name. Sometimes there is a difference. In this case I could not find any reason to pay a higher price.,1
2,These do not hold charge for long.,0
5,Of you have kiss you need these! He were pleased. These lowered all the birthday gifts without a problem.,1
1,"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Ought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. He play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. He played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pick...I was busy cleaning up the mess.",0
1,"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. To far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt.",0
5,Who doesn't need batteries,1
1,Worst batteries I've ever bought. Last about two weeks in a remote control.,0
2,These do not work good in camera. I use a small point and shoot Cannon Camera for work. With these batteries I seem to be changing them almost every time I go out. Other name brand batteries seem to last 3-4 time longer.,0
5,"To far so good!, I put dates on these batteries to check the life line when installed into batteries power items. I'll have future updated on this items. Stand by!",1
5,"Not enough now for any possible hurricane, tornado, earthquake, and other disasters that take out the electricity. YOU can never have too many batteries, just in case.",1
5,Convenient and expensive. Comparable to Duracell and energies. An't tell the difference.,1
2,"Maybe I got a bad batch. However, with 48 batteries, you'd think if that were the case that some of them would work well, and for me they have not. The main way these are being used are in an Box remote. The Box is only used to run Netflix, Full, and Amazon Video on our to, so I am basically using the game remote as a of remote. It is never used for playing video games. That being said, I am lucky if a set of 2 of these batteries lasts 10 days in this remote. That is a far cry from name brand batteries I have bought. I purchased these thinking they would be a great deal. However, going through them x as fast as other batteries makes them a worse value, not to mention it is annoying to have to change them out so often. I will use up the ones I already bought, then I will not be buying any more.",0
5,"These work as well as the name brand batteries but are cheaper and better quality than even dollar store batteries. I use the subscribe and save service Amazon offers for batteries, wiped etc and save even more making them an even better value. It the rate my kiss use of batteries for their Box controller, we need value!",1
5,"Very nice packing! Love the price and the nice convenient packing makes it easy to store, find and keep track of the batteries. Great job Amazon!",1

5,"lasted long, super reasonable price",1
1,"He bought these batteries to use in a medical Older Monitor. Typically we put batteries in for 24 or 48 hour monitor. After one use, we need to replace the batteries. These batteries did not even last the 24 hours. Patients wasted their time and the testing was wasted. It was embarrassing to make the patient schedule their test due to our equipment failure. These cost our business money. Will never buy again.",0
5,I read somewhere that batteries were one of the more over-prices items we buy. Why get those expensive brand name batteries when genetic batteries last just as long His is a super buy.,1
5,"Must as good as the name bands, maybe better. I use these in the Holiday decorations and still going strong!",1
5,"To far these batteries have outlawed the Duracell batteries they replaced in my Box remote, at a fraction of the cost!",1
5,Works good and there are cheap. I will be buying more then I need them!,1
5,I will probably never buy batteries anywhere but here again. By husband is a game and typically blows through all kinds of batteries but these do the trick. I haven noticed them needing replacement any more frequent then other major bands like duracell or energies,1
1,Most of these batteries either do not have any life left to them or they are die out after one use. terrible product.,0
1,Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart to. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other to remote.,0

3,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkaline here on Amazon.-- For camera and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Were's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. Is a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in camera or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Nina tested these AmazonBasics of's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (may), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital camera, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.To, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basis are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Funny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (may). In the other hand, they hold up better in camera and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. To, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Osteo Ireland Signature. Battery Nina's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Osteo batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Osteo member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value.",0
5,Thank You!,1
5,"I think most of the batteries I have in my house are now all AmazonBasics. These batteries are in all of our toys, badges, remote and I have never had an issue. They last as long as expected.",1
5,Great staple...,1
5,The appear to be as good as the rayovac's my kiss blow through in the gazing controller and at a slight savings. I think we'll keep using them!,1
5,"The batteries appear to be working great. I've been using two of's in my Box One controller for over a month now. Of you can get a sale on these like I did, buy, buy, buy!",1
5,These batteries work just as well as name brand batteries while being substantially cheaper. These are also package well. The cardboard box is slim and holds its shape unlike a normal plastic battery box. The batteries are shrink-wrapped together so they stay nicely in place. I just take some from the end and leave the remaining batteries nicely in their package.,1
3,The batteries are such a great deal but don't have the strength needed to run certain toys. He he a snap circuit kit and it doesn't power it enough to make the fan fly. A little disappointed.,0
2,"I use these for reading lights (the kind you clip on a book) which I use for coloring. The light gets dimmler after a few hours use the batteries I get from dollar tree last the same if not better. Duracell and energies, however, last at least 20 hours before the light gets dim.",0
5,The batteries work well.,1
5,love the easy to open packing! these batteries long very long in my door camera!,1
2,"Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a and star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. When the kiss kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Iii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of peter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name.",0
1,"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again.",0
1,"These of NOT WORK. I have tried them in 2-3 different clocks, and they are not working at all. When replaced with other batteries, the clocks started to work fine again.You get what you pay for...",0
5,Powers what I want. The future is amazing!,1
5,The good quality I expect from Amazon.,1
5,The lights seem to work real well. I have not used them for long put they are plenty bright enough for the closet I'm using them in.,1
5,"The latest reviews of name brand batteries have gone downhill lately. It seems they leak, rust, don't last, etc.. Perhaps Amazon is licensing older battery technology, or their manufacturer is anyway. To what These work better than the name bands! These are the only batteries I will buy, except Lithium Smoke Detector batteries. Amazon Any plans for Lithium batteries",1
5,The only batteries that I buy now! Price is great and they seem to hold up as good as their more expensive competition.,1
5,"Never knew that Amazon sold batteries until now. Stop buying those batteries at the grocer store and use these! I always run out of batteries in my tireless mouse and keyboard at the worst time because I ignore the low battery warnings. These batteries come in a small cardboard box about the size of 2 boxes of office pens. Inside, the batteries are wrapped in packs of 4 which keeps them neatly organized inside.Overall, these works extremely well and I will never buy batteries at the store again.",1
5,A++++ Seller. The Product was excellent and exactly what i needed.,1
5,Those of us in World War of can all appreciate what was happening in the South Pacific while we were elsewhere. I was in the North Pacific at a secret U.S.-Russian site where we were planning a joint attack of Japan. He hear nothing about what was happening farther South. The book answered our questions.,1
5,"The package provided good quality batteries in a size I need most often, without including other sizes of less usefulness. I also appreciated the packing, which is more accessible than the common drugstore packages (which can be a challenge to open).",1
2,"I bought these thinking, Great I can save some money!...... Well.... no you won't....I have to use batteries in my camera because I'm too cheap to go buy a new camera..so I bought all these batteries (2 big boxes) ....Usually 2 batteries last about 10 hours if I continuously use them, take a lot of pick.(like energies)...... Seriously, these batteries last me probably 2 hours when using them a lot...... Not bidding.....I will not purchase these.......",0
1,"To not use these in any they cadet, including remote controls, keyboard, and especially camera!",0
5,"These are fantastic alkaline batteries that work just as well as some of the name bands. They are long lasting in my controller, remote, clocks, devices, and more. I highly recommend them. Great price too. Compare and save.",1
5,"These are great batteries for around the house and I don't notice any auntie difference between them and the other major bands. The price is awesome, and they work as expected. Nothing else to say about of's really :)",1
3,"His battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Crime May for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference.",0
3,These are of for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Osteo Ireland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.,0
5,These are really good batteries. He have gotten these a few times now and haven't had any issues with them at all. They work well in everything we have tried them in. They seem to hold up just as long as other bands of batteries do. These are a good buy. would definitely recommend these batteries to other people.,1
5,To far I love it very good price and all the batteries are fully charged :) (I checked!) I also love the package that it was in. I'm using it as storage for these batteries right now very useful. I guess all I'm saying everything that comes with this are useful :),1
1,These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell of in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn't until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again.,0
5,"I keep a good stock of batteries in my house. He have lots of flashlights and toys that require them. These are nicely unfordable and I compare them to Energizer batteries, easily. (On't look at and pick if you're OCD )",1
1,"These batteries don't work well! By bluetooth mouse wouldn't stay on any more, even when I put fresh Amazon batteries in them. To I bought a new mouse and it wouldn't work with the new batteries. When I used Duracell and the mouse was fine!Same thing happened with my You remote.",0
5,"Have I sold you yet Of not, just imagine sitting on your couch, remote in hand, and all of the sudden you can't change the channel anymore. You can't turn the volume up when your girlfriend is asking you to do stuff. You can't turn the volume up when she does that stupid, annoying, thing when she eats. YOU CAN'T TURN of of WHEN SHE'S TALKING of HER MOM! Before these batteries my relationships did not last long, as girlfriend love asking you to do stuff, eating, talking to their mon. Since my purchase of these batteries, and my ability to turn the volume up to earbleeding levels whenever my girlfriend opens her mouth, I have been much, much happier.Buy these batteries.They probably also work in other things like digital thermostats (to make your house unbearable hot for her menopausal mother), flashlights, and clocks.",1
2,These leaned battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from lecky batteries.,0
1,These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..,0
5,These seem to work just as good as any other of battery but for of MUCH CHEAPER. Seems like every battery operated device in our house takes was. I buy these as well as the Amazon rechargeable ones and they all work great. To regrets with this purchase.,1
5,These seem to work just as well as the expensive name bands. I will only buy these from now on.,1
3,Ours did not last nearly as long as energies or Duracell in our sons toys. To real data to prove this other than we went through batteries like they were candy until I restored with energies.,0
2,they are cheek so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kiss toys and they don't last long.,0
5,switched to amazon brand batteries.. they are great,1
5,They make things go! There are many of them! They are not dead on arrival like some competitors.,1
3,"These do not last long. I will stick to Ireland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing.",0
5,"The batteries seem to do just as well as any other batteries I might get from the store. I appreciate the efficiency of just being able to order them from Amazon, and I like that I can get such a large quantity at a good price.",1
2,"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labelled. To I assumed they would last just as long. By of remote came with a Bony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months.",0
1,Very little capacity. They last only about 25 as long when compared with other main stream batteries,0

5,They dooooo the job at more reasonable price.,1
1,These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.,0
5,"Ought these for a couple of baby toys, and so far, they have worked great. They are much cheaper compared to other popular bands!",1
5,I bought these last year and they're still working!,1
2,I am all about Amazon Basis but I have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they don't compare at all to the Duracell ProCell that I normally order. Would love to go for a great genetic brand but this just isn't it. I've been through several of these and they are consistently much faster to run out than the ProCells.,0
1,They last a very short time once in use. But fresh ones in a soap dispense and they lasted 8 days. Other brand lasted 2 months,0
5,That a great deal! They last as long as any other 'name brand' batteries!,1

5,To far so good.,1
3,"His is my second time purchasing these Amazon of batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great.

1,Burnt up a copper string light I have been using for a years. Short life on other electronics compared to Duracell. Left in a iii controller for 2 months and leaned all over.,0
5,Solid batteries. Never been disappointed by amazon batteries before,1
5,These batteries seem to work just as good as other leading bands and at a cheaper price point! I haven't had any leads in anything I have used them in so far.,1
3,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figures that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Must foi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality.",0
5,Works like a charm.,1
3,"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. Of they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and lethal know.",0
5,These are AAA batteries and Amazon didn't mess it up. Too-how!,1
3,"These Amazon brand batteries don't seem to last quite as long as the top bands do. They're not bad, but they don't seem to have the long-lasting quality. For the price they're okay, but I think I'll stick with top bands in the future. He go through a lot of the of variety batteries and even more of these. Again, not bad but...",0
3,They don't seem to last long,0
5,"His are so good I keep coming back for more. I've used other bands and the so called good fall behind in performance. The top of the line, are really good, but they put a went in my pocket. I use this all around the house along with the AAA ones. To all give it a try before you judge them, maybe you end up with a smile and extra cash from the saving.",1
2,His does not last for more than two months on my of Magic remote.A basic remote truck lasts only for four days.,0
5,I wish I knew Amazon sold batteries sooner. He live in an isolated community and batteries cost an arm and a leg here. To far they seem to be equivalent to the other name bands. I haven't been using them long enough to tell if they last shorter or longer than other battery bands. His is a great bargain nonetheless. I will probably continue to buy my batteries here from now on.,1
5,His is my and time purchasing these batteries. They last as long as any other brand. I will continue to buy these. I have also started my office buying these.,1

I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Ought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. To therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty.

5,Very happy with these batteries. I have changed from other bands to solely the Amazon batteries.,1
5,Great deal and they work fine! Very pleased with these. Comparable to major bands.,1
5,"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Osteo, Coupon and other online retainers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly package in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost genetic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just iting on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual city. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to of and other audit devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitor them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still owing me. Previously, I swore by the Osteo batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Osteo batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresh or what. But the difference is most pronounced.To. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review. Warring that, enjoy!",1
2,These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't start without another fresh set of batteries.,0
5,Is good as any other bands like rayovac or that other one I can think of .,1
5,Very nice product and I'm very happy with it. By experience with this seller was excellent. I would not hesitate to deal with them again.,1
5,Been using these batteries for almost a year. Very pleased with them,1
1,"Very Door battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a of remote, but that's about it.",0
1,On't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon of Batteries did.,0
1,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refund, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these.",0

1,Awful. Have almost gone through a whole box to find a battery or two that actually work.,0
1,I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. May a little more for quality batteries that work.,0
2,I have no issue with the actual batteries. They work fine. By problem is with the extremely wasteful packing. The 20-pack comes in an oversized cardboard box with two shots for 10 batteries each. They could just as easily package them in a small thin cardboard box.,0
5,May better price than name brand like engergizer. I have a little boy who needs batteries for everything. His way he don't break the bank.,1
5,He always need this size battery and when the family comes to visit they sang for their electronics too. Thanks so much,1
5,He have been using Amazon batteries for a while now and they seem to last as long as any we have used and the price is better,1
5,He ordered these batteries all the time! The price is so much more reasonable than name brand batteries and they work just as well. He have a toller running around our house so as you can imagine ever single toy we own needs batteries.Totally satisfied with our purchase every time!,1
5,He've bought these a few times. He run through batteries like crazy...and these are the very best for the very least. Highly recommend!!,1
5,"Price and reviews were pretty good, only time will tell...",1
5,He've ordered these batteries twice now and they're great. They really last in my kiss toys and for the price you can't beat it. They last in a fury that's played with just about 14 hours out of the day for over a week (which is awesome!),1
2,"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my You remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for tireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them.",0
5,"For the price,they are well worth it.",1
5,Well i am a fan of the Amazon Basic items. They are life save for me.I don't have much to say as Amazon basic quality and economy prices are well know to everyone.Thank you Amazon for the Amazon Basic items.,1
5,Well I just received my second order of these batteries and of course they will come in handy with the holidays here. I have several of those artificial candles on my mantelpiece and they go through batteries like they are free. To now I am sure I have enough to get through the next several weeks!,1
5,"Whipped lightning fast! I will never buy another big brand battery - especially for bulk use. One through the pack, plenty of juice and long lasting.",1
5,It's been quite a while since I've needed batteries and I didn't want to pay the brick-and-mortar prices. They came well-package and according to Amazon they keep well. I haven't needed to use more than 2 but I can say that it came fully lowered and I hope they keep as well as advertised!,1
5,decent quality,1
5,"I love these batteries. First they are prices cheaper than the name bands but offer the same performance. They come in no frustration packing instead of the terrible clamshells that most batteries from the store do. The cardboard box offers a handy place to store them in without being cut by the plastic or having them fall out of the pack. Each four batteries is individually sealed so you can place them in odd drawers throughout the house close to the items they will be lowering. Finally I can have all the different size high performing batteries I may need without breaking the bank. You won't be disappointed with these.Please check Yes if you have found this review helpful. I rely upon others' reviews to make an informed decision daytime I make a purchase, so it is my intention to help others do the same. I welcome any questions or feedback.",1
5,That a great price. Love having extra batteries around the house at Christmas time.,1
5,They are batteries and work just like batteries should. To complaints here.,1
1,Very mixed bag of opinions about these batteries. By experience as that they are terrible. Amazon should never have put their name on such a poor product.,0
5,You can buy these at a good price and they seem to last as well as any of the big bands. To I will continue to buy these batteries.,1
5,It's expensive AAA batteries delivered to your door. I mean... what not awesome about that,1
2,"To these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail camera during cold weather the performance is poor. Heap Rayovac batteries from Rewards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again.",0
1,did order or get,0
5,Works just as well as name brand batteries but for a fraction of the price!!!,1
5,Great batteries seem just as good as expensive ones,1
5,Great price! Long lasting!,1
5,"Yes, they're AAA batteries, and they work as advertised... batteries come in a perfectly sized compact box, which can also be kept for storage purposes. Great shelves life too!!",1
5,To far these batteries are performing well and the price was unbearable too.,1
5,"Amazon batteries work just as well as other bands, why waste your money!",1
5,Very happy with my purchase of these. He fly thou batteries at my house so this was a good investment. The ones I've used so far seem to be working great and haven't died yet.His would be great for Christmas time toys!,1
5,Great product,1

5,Good batteries. Great price!,1
5,Love buying batteries from Amazon. For this many it is a great price and you don't have to carry them home from the store.,1
5,Have used about half of these now with no issues. They seem to last as long as the name bands and in this house double of are always needed.,1
2,BATTERIES have a very SHORT LIFE... WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN..,0
2,"Not a high performance battery, it's good for time lights but not for regular usage, will not order these again...",0
3,do not last as long as energies...very comparable to toys r us batteries,0
2,They don't seem to be working very well - - last a day or so in the remote,0
1,I ordered a box of these AAA. When I received them none of the batteries worked in my blameless candles. I complained and Amazon sent me another box. One of those worked either To I bought some Duracell and they worked fine. I don't understand.,0
5,"Last shipping, will buy again and again",1
5,Wonderful deal. Great product.,1
5,These batteries are awesome! Must as good as the name brand for a fraction of the price! Great job Amazon!,1
5,To far I can't tell the difference from other name brand batteries. Wonderful to be able to purchase batteries at this price and be delivered free by being a Crime Member.,1
2,Over half were dead or real close to.dead and ones that did work lose power really fast. Very disappointed in Amazon on these and their ana.,0
1,I tried charging them right out of the box and it says they are bad! I'll by my rechargeables elsewhere,0
5,Work at expected,1
5,"These batteries work great. 100 satisfied. I haven't timed them to compare them to others, but they seem to last a long time.",1
5,"I needed some and the price is good! Liked the packing...they don't all roll out when opened at one end (no so with some of the normal name bands)! Seem to be lasting as long as the other bands (but I will let you know if that statement changes).Amazon is a good brand. I'll recorder when I need more!Rep, I recommend this product",1
5,Work as well as the name bands and clot in price.,1
5,Work fine,1
5,Work fine. These are really nice and they are cheap.,1
5,"Work Great, Great Value",1
5,They work as expected and so far are lasting in the devices!,1
5,"Definitely Batteries, Definitely AAA! Work great! Great Price!",1
5,Work as well as any other batteries.,1
5,"I'm really happy with these, they really surprised me. They're head to head with top bands eg. Energizer, Duralast, Raovac. I'm definitely going to buy my batteries from here now, they're such a good deal for such great performing batteries :)",1
5,"These batteries are an awesome price, and they work just the same as purchasing Energizer or Duracell. I see no reason to ever purchase those expensive bands again. I order the bulk sizes from Amazon and they keep me stocked up for quite a long time!",1
5,Work just fine,1
5,Wonderful batteries that seem to be well-worth the price we paid!,1
5,"Work just like any other high end batteries I have purchased in the past but at a great price. Will buy more of these in the future, for sure!",1
5,"Work just as well as the name brand ones with the much higher price! Very pleased with these batteries and will buy the Amazon brand, again!",1
5,They last as long as the name brand and save some bucks too !!,1
5,To problems so far. Seem to last a long time. Very happy. Great deal.,1
5,work perfectly! great value! very happy!,1
5,"These work well in heavy duty use, I use them for my bicycle lights",1
5,"Work like batteries should, got a bunch cheap",1
5,"I used to buy bulk energies batteries at the club stores but these are cheaper, delivered to my home, and work just as well. Will definitely continue to purchase.",1
5,They work!,1
5,"I like most AmazonBasics products I've tried. They are generally good at performing their intended functions without fills: Basic!These AmazonBasics AAA batteries are less than brand name batteries at my local big-box store and appear to work just as well for me. By use in in a keyboard, several remote controls (including Fire of and Echo remote), and some radio linked thermometer I bought last century but still work great. I'm sure I use them other places I've forgotten.To they last as long as Duracell Ultra or whatever super-super alkaline I might have gotten in the past Of they don't, it's not such that I've noticed and that's good enough for me. I'm not into battery performance enough to run tests keep records! Of you are, spend more money on famous brand name batteries!That I got was a simple cardboard box with 36 cells group in fours with plastic around each four. A lot like other batteries I've purchased in the last couple of years. To packing drama and that's nice.The AmazonBasicis AAA batteries perform well enough to satisfy me, are expensive, and just fit and work wherever I need AAA cells. Must the basis and that's just what I want. When I get what I want I give 5 stars.Hope this helps someone.",1
5,Worked as advertised!,1
5,Seemed to work just like any other batteries. By boys have had them running in their remote control cars for hours.,1
5,Working fine and I really like the way they are package. They are grouped into packages of 5 batteries and plastic wrapped so you can keep them separated and also carry conveniently without worrying about them getting lost on an individual bases or possibly coming into contact with something that my cause a short or problem of some kind.,1
5,A ton of batteries for cheap. They are working great so far in my tireless Box controller that I use for my of.,1
5,There batteries... They work.,1
5,works a lot better than the ones I buy at the dollar store with much 'energy' and price is unfordable as well.,1
5,Works as advertised.,1
5,I decided to give these a try because with s 3 year old and 6.5 month old we go through so many batteries. These are working great and were cheaper than the ones we had been buying in a store. I have not noticed having to change batteries quicker than with other batteries in any of my boys' toys.,1
5,They hold up for a decent amount of time (seems close to the same amount of time as other discount batteries) but you can't beat the price.,1
5,Great value and works just like any other battery. Very economical and good deal.,1
5,Works as expected!,1
5,Keeps the remote for the of working so my lazy butt does not have to get up and mentally change channels!,1
5,Works.,1
5,"Must when you're cursing at the Box Rods for forsaking you and their non-rechargeable controller - in comes Amazon's of batteries. They're great, they last a while, and you get a cap load! Especially useful when you don't want to spend that 25 for a rechargeable battery pack that may fail in a couple months of you throwing your controller down in a rage quit.",1
5,Works as well as name brand batteries,1
5,works fine.,1
5,Works good love the packing and for a good price,1
5,Cheaper than other bands but work just as well. Will buy again!,1
5,work great thank you,1
5,WORKS GREAT,1
5,works great,1
5,"Works great so far, only small grip is they stink (like paint thinner). Weird yes I know, but nonetheless they work and that's all that counts!",1
5,Works great what more can I say. Several months in the mouse so far,1
5,Batteries! Yeah!,1
5,Great batteries and will purchase more!,1
5,Works Great!,1
5,Works great! Prepare to be crossed out by what's hiding in there...,1
5,Works just as good as other name brand batteries. I can't speak for longevity as these are used in devices that either gets used a lot or sometimes not for a week at a time. To far I would buy again.,1
5,Works just like the more expensive Duracell or engineer batteries for a fraction of the cost. The last just as long too.,1
5,"Works perfectly, I'm interested to see how they hold up over time.",1
5,Love these batteries! Wonderful price and a great product!,1
1,WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline,0
1,Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my tireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries of NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.,0
1,Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. To not buy,0
1,"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. It least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE of TIME.",0
1,"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, pour on to said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The of's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. But 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Now battery warning after a few hours use (surging dish to program guide). All showed just over 1.5 vols before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 vols. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !",0
1,These batteries are the worst batteries I've ever purchased. I am in disbelieve how quickly they died! I put them in 2 very small 4 tall portable night lights for my kiss and both night lights became very dim overnight. The batteries had to be replaced after 2 nights for the night lights to even serve the purpose. I've since put these batteries in other things around the house and I am not impressed at all. I'll stick to buying batteries at Osteo in the future.,0
1,Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.,0
5,die hard May O Sac user but due to price I am trying these based on reviews.,1
5,Finally I have enough batteries! A nice supply of batteries that seem to last as good as any and better than many. They came in a package that was good for storing them. A very useful battery as many products use them today.,1
5,Bargain,1
5,"Good bargain, great price and last as long as brand name batteries.",1
5,To far so good,1
5,Good deal.,1
5,To far these batteries have worked out just as good as the name brand.,1
5,"Cheaper than others but work just as good, if not better.",1
1,horrible --- they barely last a week in my to remote control,0
5,GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE,1
5,I like these batteries. I go through of batteries a lot with my children's toys..,1
5,48 battery for only 15 Very good deal!!! Vice battery also work perfectly.,1
5,now what value i just found my new brand of batteries last just as long as the duresall and eneagiser,1
3,Some of the batteries did not work well.,0
5,You just can't beat the price of these and they last almost as long as much more expensive bands.,1
3,"The price and packing on these batteries is wonderful, but the use-life is not. A pair of these, fresh out of the box, did not last 30 days in my Bluetooth mouse. I have gotten better results with rechargeables, and that is saying something.",0
5,Great value and great product,1
3,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Very time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment.",0
5,Up!,1
2,The two guard stops at the bottom are WAY TOO HIGH. They dig into my wrists are are painful after only 5 minutes.Everything else about the stand is excellent for a 13 lawton. It'll only work if you use an extended keyboard.Impossible to type directly on the lawton b/c of poor design. The guards just need to be brought down and 1/2 their size and this would be perfect.,0
5,"I mostly use my lawton on my lap. To figure. I have a 17 inch lawton and have tired a few other portable lawton holders, all plastic, and they have all broken with in a couple of months. His one is metal but still lightweight. It also has the added value of having a flat, perforated base which makes it more comfortable in my lap and it gives me a place to place peripheral such as external hard drives. I am very happy with this product and recommend it.",1
3,"Of you're looking for something to keep your lawton cool, this will do the trick. Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivers where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend..",0
5,I purchase two of these backpacks for my wife and son's captors. The case is well constructed and has many compartments. Its a great backpack for the price.,1
3,Too small for 17 he envy very tight fit. Otherwise great product,0
5,Love it,1
3,"Too many shippers IMO. Good quality, but the shippers frequently get caught making it slightly annoying to open.",0
5,Amazing..... Sturdy and well pocket.... Well worth the investment...very happy with this purchase. It has been holding up quite nicely.,1
3,"His bag does not fit my 17-inch lawton, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch lawton to make this work. Also, as some other reviews described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the shippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone.",0
5,many department for my ideas and is perfectly design fitted for my needs.,1
3,"There's a lot of space with the Amazon Basis lawton and a number of great compartments, but the material it's made from feels kind of stiff and expensive. I was impressed at how much I could get into this backpack, but once it was packed it felt very big and bulky. By normal backpack is a smaller one from Timberline which has less compartments but seems to hold a great deal of stuff and not feel nearly as bulky as this one.",0
5,"Even though this is classified as a lawton backpack, I'm really finding it much more useful as an all-purpose backpack. Of course, you could carry your lawton in it - there's a compartment specifically designed for one (17 or less) - but it's also comfortable and useful for general use.The backing is very sturdy. His sturdiness is designed to protect a lawton from tumbler and falls, but I love it for other reasons: First, I can throw all sorts of june in this backpack (big books, a luncheon, shoes, etc.) and nothing bulges from the back. His happens often with other backpacks, causing them to be difficult to carry, but the sturdy backing prevents this here. Second, it is quite comfortable. It's not a hard plastic backing, but just seems to be rigidly padded, and it almost feels like it's helping my posture when I wear it.By only complaint, and it isn't a big one, is that there are almost too many pockets and organizational compartments. It can get a bit complicated remembering where something is, especially if you have a lot of stuff. His may just take a bit more getting used to, however, and it doesn't diminish the fact that this is a really great backpack. In fact I'd add that all this extra room inside the backpack is a bonus. Yes, I am really quite liking this backpack.",1
3,"Gros- Feels Right weight even when stuffed fully. Perfect no. of compartments.Sons - Door nipper quality, side such for water container is small.",0
5,Well made. Seems sturdy. Multiple compartments to store gear.Very price effective compared to other products made for the same uses.I'll see how it holds up with time.,1
3,"Nipper on front kept coming apart. Since this opens to the base of the backpack, I almost lost an item. Double check this when you get it give it a few solid tubs",0
3,"BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Its the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which says and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack.

5,"holds everything lawton,amp,mind external memory drive,headphones,d glasses,tablet tables,and still have 2 extra pockets awesome,well made product. thank you !",1
3,I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully. It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the lawton trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra wheels and buy a case that fully opens.,0
5,"Having looked elsewhere for this product and found them really expensive, found this on Amazon at a fantastic price and was really pleased with it.",1
2,"arrived on time well packed disappointed with quality does the job it was only for keeping dust off second lawton,a very tight fit though",0
5,"I have the Western Digital By Passport Ultra 2TB USB 3.0 Portable Drive 2.5 (lawton size) external hard drive. The hard drives case is mostly plastic with a thin pretty metal sheet top that's more for aesthetic than protection. I originally bought the watching extra-tough god like of Woman Tugged case that offers great protection. Once fitted into the Woman, the drive stays in the sealed protective case with only the USB3 port accessible behind a rubber flap - and given the light-weight feel of the of Passports plastic drive case the extra protection of the Woman was reassuring. However there's a big negative negative in that the case has nowhere to store the short cm USB3 cable (plus the Woman god hides the drive LEDs). Is an alternative I tried this cheap Amazon Basic 2.5 external hard drive case.The AmazonBasics case is less ruggedised, but the By Passport Ultra drive fitted the case perfectly, and very useful the case has plenty of space for storing the USB3 cable (it fits in behind a petted pocket on the top flap). The hard drive itself is held in by a strap to prevent the drive slipping out when you open the case. Laptop size 2.5 hard drives have extra shock protection over their 3.5 desktop versions, being designed for portable use, so this AmazonBasics case offers more than adequate protection when traveling (I slip my case into the backpack when commuting). I now find I'm using the case in preference to the Woman version simply as it's far more convenient for keeping tabes on the drive's USB3 cable. His AmazonBasics case works well, seems well made, and it's very cheap at 7, so 5* for function and value.",1
3,Isn't the same as the picture.,0
5,His older also expands on the bottom. Will allow A LOT more than when the bottom does not expand. Ought a second. I recommended this to my friends.,1
3,I bought this because the package said it was a fast charge only to find it charges at normal speed... That was disappointing. I'm pretty sure I'm not doing anything wrong. It seems pretty self explanatory... :/,0
5,Ought this charge for the Kindle voyage and its great.,1
3,it does not charge any faster than regular charge.,0
2,"The only problem that I had is that it should have been included with the Kindle Paperwhite. There is no way to charge the Paperwhite unless you buy the charge. The charging port on the Paperwhite is so small that nothing that I already have will work. Kindle does not even provide a USB cable so that you can charge from your computer. The outlet plug is cheek plastic (hollow) and will probably break, no warranty.",0
5,Exactly what I needed. Didn't want to settle for a genetic off brand charge. Thanks to West Buy I didn't have to.,1
5,"His works well, charges book readers quickly and easily",1
2,"When I got my Kindle Fire, I got a protective cover for it and figured I'd be ok, because I don't travel much at all (am bedridden/disabled from car accidents). After a while, I couldn't get the mind-USB cord to stay in the plug on the Kindle. After describing the problem to Amazon, they sent me a new cord (I got the newer one with an of plug and had to pay for it). Unfortunately this did not solve the problem, and I had to mail them my Kindle, and they shipped me a new one, configured mostly the way I had everything before I sent it, which was very convenient. Using my new cable (purchased through the Amazon Kindle store), I had no problems, at first.With only very light use, primarily for reading books for short intervals, the problem I had before with the mind USB plug on the Kindle not fitting tightly into its socket. After changing up of to USB, as well as trying both USBs on my computer, I was unable to get the Kindle to start because it had less than 15 charge on the battery but I had no way to charge it. The only way to resolve the issue would be to go through the procedure described above I read a number of the positive reviews (which are usually posted first), and nothing was mentioned about this problem--there were so many reviews I didn't have the time to go through them all. I'm in the middle of a book, and use the Kindle to play Rabble with a friend, and we're in the middle of a game...To I haven't decided what to do yet... It's after 5 a.m. Sunday morning so I can't call the Kindle Tore for advice.I had been considering upbraiding to one of the new Kindle products, but after having this recurring problem, I am very of spending that kind of money, only to possibly have the same issue.Head more",0
5,"He have several echoes and dots throughout our house, we use it to listen to music, check the weather, traffic, adjust settings on our smart home devices, create shopping lists, use it as a kitchen time, check facts, use as an interior, phone family, as a bedside alarm, listen to music throughout the house, and the list just goes on and on. It really is a personal assistant, new skill are appearing every day and It's fun finding new things she can do and answer. Over expanding knowledge base and skill are the biggest feature, not likely to become obsolete very soon .....",1
2,"I really liked the idea of having a device I could talk to out of nowhere that would answer (although our cells phone can do similarly, but you have to turn them on and press buttons, etc.). It is also gratifying to be able to tell a device to play music and it does. I was quite disappointed in the ability of Plea to answer any serious questions. Jeff needs to pay to send his programme back to search school. To many times Plea says a phrase similar to I don't understand the question To basically I paid for a radio. I paid extra for the larger one, but the output is still no different than a clock radio. Some on Amazon!!!",0

5,"I own two echo and 1 amazon first. Plea is on all. Echo is great if.... you of subscribe to Amazon Crime Membership and get the free music that comes with it. (Crime comes with 250 song limit) I also have added the extra 250,000 songs for 29 and now have unloaded over 13,000 songs of my own. I don't need to listen to the music I can't stand! 50's 60's some 70's and 80's are what I want and instrumental Mantovani, 101 strings, Paul Mauriat, Herb Alert, etc sound great on it.Must have to say: Plea, scuffle Veil Diamond, Plea, scuffle Tula Clark, Plea, play Round of Music, Plea, what is the temperature. Plea, score Tubs etc. You get the idea. You can set multiple alarms up to 24 hours in advance, You can ask for Hotels and Hotels around Dubuque, of. Now many days till Christmas (or any date you ask for). I fall to sleep every night with Plea, play Streams and Birds. The will then play a water stream with birds singing. or whatever you want to hear such as rainforest, thunder and rain, frog along the Mississippi, etc. They ARE part of my life now. I sit outside and listen to whatever type of music I'm in the mood for. It must have a WIFI connection to be used, and some type of pad, Kindle fire, pad, phone, etc. to set it up to your (or anyone) WIFI. You must download the Plea Pp (free on Amazon), to set it up with your home location, and your WIFI. Of you plug it from one outlet in your home and want to take it outside, as long as it can still get WIFI, all you have to do is plug it in and it will find your wife again. I just can't say enough about how I like it and it WILL be getting a lot better as they are still upbraiding them.Head full review...",1
2,"His is fun but would not buy again. Not very information. Keeps say ""I do not understand your question. """,0
3,"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to input. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Would not play any, Add,",0
5,His is a must for Crime members great sound and can be used as Bluetooth speaker to boot.,1
5,"Music, full home automatic control, an assistant, calling, shopping and lists, much much more...anywhere with wife, home or away. Met one, you will not regret it.",1
3,"Plea works great, but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible, your much better off with a echo dot and bone sound link mind set up.",0
5,"By family and I are enjoying Plea. Great for playing music, setting times, adding to shopping list, etc. Still finding new and useful things to do with it.",1
1,He are unable to connect WIFI on this product. He have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.,0
5,I would recommend it. It is fun to use and puts out good sound.,1
1,Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. By first problem didn't haired.,0
1,His review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Must upgrade to the ECHO instead of the tap.,0
1,He were so excited to get the tap since it was a larger speaker than the dot and unlike the echo has a battery charge with it to make it portable. He already have an echo which works perfectly in our home. When listening to online radio on the tap it cut in and out constantly. He returned it and exchanged for the dot.,0
2,I have the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.,0
5,Great sound in a small package for the money and I would buy again.,1
5,Great little device easy to connect to bluetoothDecent sound,1
5,great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside. the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button was a surprise but a welcome one!,1
5,Enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good.,1
3,"Overall for an Plea product it does the same thing as all the other ones. His one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging. The one main issue is that it is not voice activate (meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mid button in front. By having this feature, I could see it causing excess battery usage. Needs to be able to apes better.",0
5,"I love my Echo Cap! I have my own personal alarm, informs me on today's weather forecast and local events. Great purchase.",1
3,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cut but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room.",0
5,Good product works amazing . Works awesome from home .,1
3,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.,0
5,My I am so enjoying this. Sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn't require plugs or wires. Saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet West Buy. Lay it now everyday.,1
3,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment,0
5,I bought this as a gift for Christmas and it was well liked,1
3,I recommend this speaker Easy to work great sound,0
5,His is not like the Amazon Echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good...but you will lose bass if it's at max volume (not recommended if you like bass),1
3,Great Speaker but I really don't need the features. I just need good sound and don't really use anything besides that,0
5,Great teach works well highly recommended no issues,1
2,I was not overlay impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my shone. I had to download a music pp and then load my music into the pp. It wouldn't work. May too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a bl portable Bluetooth speaker.,0
3,"I was really excited for this speaker. Not it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. When I listened to the music. It has no bass. Of you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. To low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it",0
2,"I should have done some research before buying the Cap. I would have rather had the upgrade version that is voice activate. Also, I thought it would be more like Fire where you can ask anything. Plea's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine.",0
5,His speaker is great for the price. I love how the speaker is 360 degrees so you get the same sound in any part of the room.,1
5,With this you have someone to talk to and answers you.,1
5,I the awesome I use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where,1
2,"I'm thinking this must of been a luke, it never worked. Had to return item but received full refund",0
5,It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift. It was a gift.,1
3,"Doesn't understand some commands or Questions,but good overall",0
3,I own an echo and the tap. The tap is slower to respond. Of you haven't used the echo then you will like the tap.,0
3,Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activate..so u have to push the wake button daytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...,0
5,"Now that you don't have to actually tap it to get the full function out of it, its great. Have the original Echo, and the Not also. Wish I had only bought two of these, the charge is great and we take it wherever we want to go.",1
5,It has a good sound. The battery last long and it connect easily to iii and blue tooth. But you have to touch a button before you speak to it.,1
2,"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratch.. It was a good concept just poor execution.",0
5,Ought this for our 7 and 5 year old. They love to play music and ask questions about science. Lots of fun!,1
5,Now that this supports hands free access and amazon has discontinued it this is the last chance to get a battery operated echo device.,1
2,"Love the Not, Late the Cap Portable! His device will not hold a charge for even one day. The dots are amazing though.",0
3,Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Plea is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that',0
5,"Great speaker, Love using voice commands, Even my granddaughter use the voice command to search for songs.",1
5,Really like the I I & being able to take it to any room in the house. By music sounds great. Love all the features.,1
3,Vice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better.,0
5,Round quality is amazing. I really like the ability to take this on the go. Downside. I wish I didn't have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up,1
1,"hard to use, and does not support Guam. online instructions not clear",0
3,Amazon Cap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..,0
3,"I wouldn't buy it again...the software doesn't seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine. I also have an Echo and I don't have the same conductivity issues with it that I do with this. I liked the features available with this...probability mainly with a long battery life, but with plagued by conductivity issues I can't say I would recommend it. I have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered I am not the only one that feels this way. The sound, when it is connected and responding, is amazing.",0
2,Must really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.,0
2,"Like DOS, you need to memories your command and speak it out, otherwise it may not understand your command. Google Assistant is smarter. Also you can use Notify free account, to work around you must add a lot of free music to Amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music. Google home is more convenient this case, as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from Notify. Of you have paid account for Notify then not much different here. But to do searching you may be disappointed with this Cap, Google Some is just much smarter. The sound of this Cap is very good indeed, but I return it because it can do music alarm, also it can use Notify for free, also its search is not smart enough, so I switched to Google Some.",0
2,"For the price, you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone. I had to use my daughter's Seats Will for this function, therefore it's not worth all the hope.",0
3,You need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan. Disappointing for sure. The sound is ok. I think the larger model is probably better.,0
5,"I wanted to buy a Cap when it was first released. I have several Echo's in the house, but having a portable Plea enabled device is awesome. Unfortunately, when it was first released, the tap could not be operated hands-free. I held off purchasing one because I was afraid Amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature.Earlier this year Amazon enabled hands-free mode, and it works almost as well as the Echo, despite having fewer microphone.Round quality is very good. It's a small speaker but very capable. Battery life is excellent. His is currently the most flexible implementation of Plea and I recommend it.",1
5,"I have the Echo and a Not and now the Cap, too. By only issue with the Cap is that I got it after the Echo. His means that by the time I got the Cab, I was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my Echo. Of course with the Cap you have to physically get up and touch the Cap. I think if I had first started out with the Cap and having to touch it, it wouldn't be so difficult now for me remember to tap the Cap. But it is a habit to just call out now. To I wish I'd gotten the Cap first and then had graduated to the Echo. Cry the Cap first. You might decide you don't even need an Echo. You definitely won't be disappointed !!",1
5,"I purchased a Echo for home so added a Cap for my office at work, so I can chat with Plea at work and my main reason was for a decent of speaker for my office. His has great sound streaming my Crime music and of vis the of pp. An't go wrong. Quality music and Plea when I need some help with spelling hard word's, she getting smart. Sick one up. You have a woman to talk to when the wife is out.",1
3,"The product works well. However, you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device, Plea. I really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome!!",0
3,"Of you want a Cap to make use of Amazon's Plea voice services, then dont get one. The Cap is a fine enough Bluetooth speaker for tireless music, but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable.",0
3,"His product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting",0
3,Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product,0
3,I returned it because I wanted better sound...often for a bone sounding. Recent speaker with nice amazon prime/Plea features...just not the sound I was looking for.,0
2,just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Fire better.,0
5,You can take everywhere your music and with wife you are connected with the world. The best is that the battery lasts a long time.,1
5,Incredible range. Clear sound. He bought the sleeve and hung it in the backward for a party. Amazing 360 clear sound.,1
5,He love our Amazon Echo but it is hard wired to kitchen. Because of where we live of reception is poor but through an Echo or Amazon Cap I can listen to some of my favorite stations through heart Radio and the Cap is portable.,1
5,"Anyone needing a compact and easily mobile speaker should look at this. The sound quality is excellent, it is easy to son via Bluetooth and gives you the ability to stream music when connected to wife. Great product for the price and perfect for the office.",1
5,Great speaker for around the house listening to music and asking questions,1
5,"Ought the Cap for my mon to primarily listen to music. Although my mon forgets ""the girl's name"" hata, we've found Plea will answer without saying her name. The rechargeable base is nice so the Cap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wife. Round is great, too! Pleased!",1
5,"His speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the ratio or in any room that I am in. The tap is annoying compared to the Echo with voice motivation, but the tireless features makes the purchase worth it.",1
5,I ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful! I'm totally happy with my purchase!!!,1
5,I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it.,1
5,"bought as a gift for my daughter. actually sounds better and easier to set up than expected. the personal assistant feature is really amazing, instant response to requests for information and music.",1
3,It works about 50% of the time when asking it a question.,0
5,"Powerful and quality sound, love the probability. Must don't understand why this one can't read my modifications while the dot can.",1
2,"While it seemed to work fine, the Cap does not have the open mid feature. While that can be best for some, I bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens. The Cap makes you press the mid button every time you wish to communicate with Plea, which seems to defeat the purpose.",0
5,Love it I bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there was,1
3,"The Amazon Echo Cap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. To what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Cap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audit quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Cap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home i-i, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other i-i?? That is not going to work very well.",0
5,Most speaker like this will be over USD150.00 but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality,1
1,It's very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a bone sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it,0
5,Love it works great a lot of fun great for listening to music,1
3,"His product, while the speaker is great, fails to deliver with a voice interface. Use your cell phone or computer and buy an Echo Not.",0
5,"It was just a few weeks ago that I was moaning the fact that I did not scoop up an Echo back when they were being released last year. Not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price, but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device...Well, here I am, a year late to the game and I can now proudly say that I own both an Echo and this new little Cap! An I just say that I am OBSESSED with all things Echo and Plea. These are devices that you may not realize how much you'll use it until you've given them a try.I have been spending the last few years getting our home automatic. I currently use a combination of Smartthings, IFTTT and Logitech Harmony to control the home. Plea fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice. For me, this is the killer feature. I can integrate all three parts of our home control right into Echo/Cap and make our house even smarter with very minimal set.Head more",1
1,"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech of BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79",0
5,The Amazon Cap is a great addition to my Smarthome system. He particularly like that we can move it from room to room without of attached & the battery lasts a long time. He even take it outside to listen to music from Amazon Crime and Notify. He recommend it highly.,1
3,Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.,0
5,"I have the Amazon dot, which is great. But after purchasing the tap, which was on sale too, I was sold. You can take it any where. And the sound is great!!!",1
1,I spent more time trying get it sanctioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to of. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didnIt appreciate.,0
5,Plea works great. It was easy to set-up and to us. By wife uses it for playing music through her shone and is very happy with it. I am always finding and learning new things with Plea.,1
3,"Such better than the echo dot. However, the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying. Speaker is fairly powerful for its size.",0
5,"It's so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights, or play music. To convenient. Love this!",1
3,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the to and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone pp. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. To a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't,0
5,By wife uses the Cap mostly to listen to music. The loves the fact that she can take it into and room of the house. To more having to turn up the sound to hear I'm different parts of the house.,1
1,Would not get it to work properly. I put the pp on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.,0
5,"I was impressed with the sound of the original Echo, the price of the Not. The Echo Cap is the best of both and Portable. I have echo in multiple rooms. I got this to bring music outside to the ratio. The music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk. Now that SiriusXM is on Plea too I have access to great music, Toward stern, NFL, MLB and all the rest of the satellite radio content. The great thing about the tap is unlike a normal Bluetooth speaker this one works solo with Plea and wife. Even my wife loves it I think she talks to Plea now more than she talks to me.",1
3,"His was advertised as the latest version 8. By ignorance led me to its 79 price. I thought they were all Paperwite - as in just like white paper in a book. Ought it for my wife. I returned mine as a refused shipment and ordered the PaperWhite. It has a backlight, higher resolution, and for 20, worth it. Hinder 1",0
5,I really enjoy reading and on my had was hurting my eyes. His Kindle really works great.,1
1,Is Amazon bidding me They want me to pay 19.99 for an item that is a critical part of the sanctioning of their product Outrageous. I will find another Of charge.,0
1,I bought this thinking that I needed it but I didn so it was a waste of money. I do so hate to waste money. the Kindle can hook to a regular cell phone charge and it comes with a cable that connect to the computer. For some reason I thought I just had to have this too when I bought my Kindle.,0
1,"One star because this should've been included when I purchased my Candles. Ought this second one because I have three paper whites and got tired of playing musical charge chairs. And if Amazon would concentrate on the loyal e-book readers rather than the useless fires and increase memory more than the little bit they did on the latest kindle (I own one) I would be a happy hamper. He need the option of adding memory (Amazon invent a chip that only you sell and the only one a kindle can use and I'll purchase). Must give us that option. Fires don't work for just straight up reading (can't read in any kind of light because of the shiny screen). Having to purchase these power adapted separately tricks me off. I don't care about the cloud. I need books download to my devices. He vacation often in our mountain house. Middle of nowhere (which I like). However, no wife, no Internet access and no cell coverage so cloud is useless. I guess I read too much. Thousands of books. 5,000+ in my library at home before a stroke forced me to Kindle and now thousands more. Include adapted when purchasing devices and increase the storage capacity.",0
1,"To reason. His product is described as Of, 1 amp. The Kindle line is mainly Of (4.Of, what's the difference) and around 1 amp, which is 5 Parts (Of). Why the mystery, guns Also, this deal is for of 110V market only I travel. I like that the previous simple FIRE charge was universal (i.e. 100V-240v). I like that the first Kindle charge was also universal. That are you people doing Or, is it that the copywriter in this case just doesn't understandFor those who don't understand the details of electricity, ANY device will tell you what it needs to feed. Voltage (V) is one thing to look at and your charge needs to say something within the range of 100 and 240 vols to meet your device need. Is far as AMPS (A). Of your device says it needs 1.8 A. It's perfectly fine to buy a charge that has a rating higher than that. Like 2 Lips. The device will only drink as much as it needs. A device that needs 1.8 A plugged into a 2 A charge just means the charge is taking a nap. Must avoid situations where your device needs more Lips than a charge can provide. It won't necessarily explode but it will extend charge times and is generally not recommended.",0
5,Is advised. Same really fast,1
5,as described.,1
5,great wires.,1
5,Great feel and seems to be very well made,1
1,"By Kindle Voyage is nearly 16 months old and worked perfectly. I kept receiving email from Amazon about the software update. I switched off airplane mode, switched on wife and shortly after the screen locked up. I have tried everything with customer support and they now tell me I will have to buy a new one. I am very annoyed. Of I had left the software as it was my Kindle Voyage would still be working.",0
5,Fantastic for reading in dark conditions. Very light and easy to hold.,1
2,"I accidentally cracked my screen on the first day when the Voyage was too close to my rocking chair and neither West Buy nor Amazon would do anything to help. Well, Amazon offered $15 off purchasing the Paperwhite and that wasn't something I wanted at all. Now I'm stuck with a $199 broken Voyage. Not a happy customer. I realize it was my fault but thought they should do something more to minimize the loss and keep my business.",0
5,"Vice reader for reading books. Trouser should be improved otherwise fine for reading books, another irritating part is as pop up which amazon shed fix",1
2,i can at night it has no back light from one to ten its a 7,0
5,"Leading on my commune, or in a waiting room, is a pleasant way to pass time - and convenient",1
3,"turning pages not as easy as the original ones; whole Some Age experience not really user friendly, and seems feared to just sell you more books.",0
5,His is my very first kindle. I am enjoying reading more books. The size is quite comfortable as well as the weight. The battery life is quite good. Of you're looking for a new way to read book this is definitely the one.,1
1,"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't rest, etc. Since my West Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from West Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-(",0
5,The voyage is so much easier on the eyes. The size is great and easy to carry in a briefcase for travel purposes.,1
3,Clear reading in bright light outdoor settings. Long battery life.,0
5,"But of the box there really is nothing to do but plug it in to the USB drive and you're ready to go. You get a pop up reminder asking if you want to use the drive as a back up. Of you select yes or no that will be the last time you see it. Of you say ""decide later"" it will come up each time you plug it in to the USB drive.",1
3,"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental brother is not very user friendly.",0
5,Not this for my pre been who took to it like a duck to water. It is great size and easy to pack,1
2,"The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience fearless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it. Hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon (and the price of early adoption, sometimes), because overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the (working) Voyage.",0
5,Easy to read in the sunlight. I really like that it adjust to the lighting available making it easy to read anywhere.,1
3,It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensory is little too high. In insight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.,0
5,"Right weight, great upgrade from the paperwhite. Love it!",1
3,By son truly loves his Kindle. He uses it everyday.,0
5,His kindle has better resolution and contrast ratio.It is light and comfortable. I would recommend this device at deal price.,1
3,Ve had the st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homage isn as friendly,0
5,"The flush been and display are a huge improvement. The text is crisp and easy on the eyes. The page press function and inclusion/position of the touch sensory is perfect. The price seems a bit high for something as simple as an E-Leader, but if you love to read this is a must have. You will not be disappointed.",1
3,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operate great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.,0
5,"Kindle is the best. In this version, storage and resolution screen has been improved.",1
3,"I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Age turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audit option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no Of. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it.",0
3,Was a Christmas gift and I ended up returning it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.,0
5,"He bought this reader to replace a Fire HDX that had seemed to go only. Burns out a couple of system rests and the HDX is back to normal so I get the old one, she gets the new one.But I can highly recommend this reader - the clarity of the text and the overall functionality is excellent.",1
5,"Vice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice",1
3,It has what i wanted click to turn page and that is the only reason i paid that price for it. there is nothing special about it. i thought that the battery would last longer and as an aid reader it doesn't last long enough.,0
3,Replaced a ve nook but this is not better for reading,0
3,Have had it for a while not. A littlebit unusual to press so hard to change page but now starting to get used to it.,0
5,"By wife and I both enjoyed our Kindle Voyage so much that we had to buy a second one. His is our first E-reader, and it could not be more user-friendly. It works well in all kinds of environment and lighting conditions. A definite winner!",1
5,the best feature of this Kindle is the page forward/back buttons which allow you to turn pages without taking hands off the unit.,1
5,The voyage is light and has a battery life of Two weeks. In different light settings the Voyage automatically adjust. By eyes do not get tired from bad lighting. Leading outside is no problem for the Voyage.,1
1,very good proud it and service will definitely refer to a friend.,0
5,"I purchased this to replace my first gen Paperwhite. The shadows on the bottom of the Paperwhite always gathered me. I decided to upgrade to the Voyage and it is much better. I like the physical page turn buttons, the higher dip, and the consistent back lighting. I think the only issue I have with the Voyage is the auto brightness seems a little finicky and I sometimes have to adjust the brightness mentally. But that's a small issue for an otherwise great e-reader.",1
1,I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make),0
5,By little girl loves her Kindle. I'm so happy I bought an upgrade to her previous kindle. West Christmas gift ever.,1
3,I was hoping to use Google launched with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launched or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching moves.,0
5,The loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her,1
3,"By father upgrade from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books.",0
5,"The clarity of the screen and the back-lit text makes this an improvement from my old tablet. I now can read this in low light and enjoy the color as well. I am enjoying my new Kindle, but it did present some challenges in its set up. I would recommend getting help in the store to get you started.",1
3,"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clung. Constant modifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader pp surprisingly is less than intuition.",0
5,"I purchased two of these for my kiss, ages 12 and 10. Forget the good touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and moves for free all included with my Amazon Crime membership. Awesome!!",1
3,"His is good for kiss. Heap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset",0
1,"Of as dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spasm, it kept loading it up making it slow and baggy. Plus the carrasoul lookout makes it hard to navigable for kiss, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the as but it wont remove them all. Buy the samson, better everything!",0
5,Great product for my 8 year & unfordable.. had 2 months & no problems,1
5,Ought for my 7 or old. Quality product at an unfordable price. Ought on sale for $69.99.,1
3,"I bought this for my daughter. It was bundles with a solid jumper case and has a kid mode interface. The insisted on using her brother's had constantly. Not to say there is anything wrong with this product, it just wasn't for her.",0
3,"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apes seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes responsive and inaccurate-which can be frustration for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead download. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users.",0
5,His my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audit books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal,1
5,I highly recommend kindled. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. His has wife capabilities. I would highly recommend this item.,1
3,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Same back on after an hour.,0
5,Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.,1
2,"Of you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the had mind from a liability, functionality and available apes standpoint.",0
5,my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!,1
3,me. it works. i find it difficult to navigable. i also have an pad mind. this seems to be less intuition than the pad.,0
5,Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.,1
3,"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for moves and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photo to others.",0
5,His tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.,1
2,Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept starting and reporting I had to return it.,0
1,The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke,0

5,"His is the right device to play with puzzled, you can avoid samson/horizon constant advertisements. Only wish the battery would last longer or charge faster.",1
3,"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Gros:Install Google Lay without any hassleVery good book reading option",0
5,His tablet is an easy device to download sites and convenient too!,1
3,"His tablet is of, sometimes it's kind of slow. Roads for a while before opening pp. Storage has been good. 32 of. I gave my son the freedom to download any game he wanted on prime time. And after 2 months he still has like go left of space. Not recommend for kiss over 10 years old. By son is 4 and sometimes he gets mad because tablet gets slow. Still good deal for 32gb, 1 year primitive for $80",0
1,Does not let me connect with my library. Very disappointed,0
5,Love best buy and I shop at West Buy I always buy my of for me and my kiss I buy my kiss tablets at West Buy Love West Buy,1
5,I bought this for my son and I couldn't be happier. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends,1
3,upgrade my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesn seem that great of a difference. the graphics interface still sucks but its decent for reading.,0
5,"I am very satisfied with this tablet. I use it for browsing because the screen is larger than my phone. Caught it on sale and bought two. Good value for the money. It was recommended by a friend. Met a case for it, it is easier to hold on to. The second one will make a nice gift.",1
3,Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Patches video mostly but should last longer than that.,0
1,"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. He decided to union them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apes or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for andros type kiss tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it.",0
5,His is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!,1
3,"it has great disability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok",0
5,"Expensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Type on it already...",1
5,was one of the best things i got for my little one,1
3,West gift for Beginers. Less Price and enough speed and memory. Lids like it a lot.,0
5,"Love this tablet, it is better than my pad! There are unlimited full length games, books, etc. I wait for my granddaughter to go to sleep, so I can play it! Great battery life, too. I highly recommend this tablet for adults and children!",1
3,"His is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse.",0
5,"Purchased this for my wife during Christmas and got a great deal on it. Compared to the older version that she has this model is faster, brighter, and more convenient with Plea. I would recommend this product looking for a tablet with lots of features packed in it.",1
1,I liked it at first except the brother is kind of clung. Also you can. It use all andros Pp. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried charging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Mind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.,0
5,His expensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabes on my kiss and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.,1
3,"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my moves on it from my nook. His is becoming industry standard. Too bad.",0
5,Purchased due to reviews and in sale. To far easy to use.,1
2,The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindled.,0
3,"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kiss take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item.",0
